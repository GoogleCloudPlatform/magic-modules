# Generate `google` and `google-beta` providers

After making a change to the Terraform providers for Google Cloud, you must
integrate your changes with the providers. This page explains how to generate
provider changes to the `google` and `google-beta` Terraform providers.

## Before you begin

1. [Set up your development environment]({{< ref "/develop/set-up-dev-environment" >}}).
1. Update `magic-modules` as needed. These updates could be any of the following changes:
  + [Adding a resource]({{< ref "/develop/add-resource" >}}).
  + [Adding a datasource]({{< ref "/develop/add-handwritten-datasource" >}}).
  + [Adding custom resource code]({{< ref "/develop/custom-code" >}}).
  + [Promoting a resource to GA]({{< ref "/develop/promote-to-ga" >}}).

**Note on Default Behavior:** By default, running a full `make provider` command now cleans the output directory (`OUTPUT_PATH`) before generating code to prevent sync issues. Use `SKIP_CLEAN=true` to bypass this. Specifying `PRODUCT=...` also skips the clean; this is considered **advanced usage**, and it's recommended to run a full, clean build beforehand if your repositories might be out of sync. See the [`make` commands reference]({{< ref "/reference/make-commands" >}}) for details.

## Generate a provider change

1. Clone the `google` and `google-beta` provider repositories with the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google
   git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta
   ```
1. Generate changes for the `google` provider:
    ```bash
    # Full Build (Recommended)
    make provider VERSION=ga OUTPUT_PATH="$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google"

    # Product-Only Build (Advanced - Example: 'compute' product)
    make provider VERSION=ga OUTPUT_PATH="$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google" PRODUCT=compute
    ```

    If you have already performed a full, clean build and want to iterate faster on a specific product, you *can* limit generation using `PRODUCT`. This skips the pre-generation cleanup and only generates files related to the specified product (plus common handwritten files).
      
    Replace `compute` with the desired product name from the [`mmv1/products`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/tree/main/mmv1/products) directory.

1. Generate changes for the `google-beta` provider:
    ```bash
    # Full Build (Recommended)
    make provider VERSION=beta OUTPUT_PATH="$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta"

    # Product-Only Build (Advanced - Example: 'compute' product)
    make provider VERSION=beta OUTPUT_PATH="$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta" PRODUCT=compute
    ```

    If you have already performed a full, clean build and want to iterate faster on a specific product, you *can* limit generation using `PRODUCT`. This skips the pre-generation cleanup and only generates files related to the specified product (plus common handwritten files).

   Replace `compute` with the desired product name from the [`mmv1/products`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/tree/main/mmv1/products) directory.

1. Confirm that the expected changes were generated:
   ```bash
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google
   git diff -U0
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta
   git diff -U0
   ```


   {{< hint info >}}
   **Note**: There may be additional changes present due to specifying a
   `PRODUCT=` value or due to the `magic-modules` repository being out of sync
   with the provider repositories.

## Troubleshoot

### Too many open files {#too-many-open-files}

If you are getting “Too many open files” ulimit needs to be raised.

{{< tabs "ulimit" >}}
{{< tab "Mac OS" >}}
```bash
ulimit -n 8192
```
{{< /tab >}}
