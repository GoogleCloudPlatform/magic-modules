# Set up your development environment

Before you start adding or updating a Terraform resource using
[magic-modules]({{< ref "/" >}}), you must first set up your environment by
installing the necessary tools. This page explains the steps for setting up your
development environment.

1. [Install the gcloud CLI.](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
1. In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or
   [create a Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).
   {{< hint info >}}

   **Note:** If you don't already have a project to use for testing changes to
   the Terraform providers, create a project instead of selecting an existing
   poject. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing
   all resources associated with the project.

1. Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project. Learn how to
   [check if billing is enabled on a project](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled).


1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
1. [Install go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
1. Add the following values to your environment settings such as `.bashrc`:
   ```bash
   # Add GOPATH variable for convenience
   export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)
   # Add Go binaries to PATH
   export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
   ```
1. Install goimports
   ```bash
   go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
   ```
1. [Install terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
1. Clone the `magic-modules` repository
   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules.git
   ```

1. Run the following command from the root of your cloned `magic-modules` repository.
  
   ```bash
   cd magic-modules
   ./scripts/doctor
   ```
 
   Expected output if everything is installed properly:
 
   ```
   Check for go in path...
      found!
   Check for goimports in path...
      found!
   Check for git in path...
      found!
   Check for terraform in path...
      found!
   Check for make in path...
