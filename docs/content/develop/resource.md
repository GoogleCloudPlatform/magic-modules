# Add or modify a resource

This page describes how to add a new resource to the `google` or `google-beta` Terraform provider using MMv1 and/or handwritten code.

For more information about types of resources and the generation process overall, see [How Magic Modules works]({{< ref "/get-started/how-magic-modules-works.md" >}}).

## Before you begin

1. Complete the [Generate the providers]({{< ref "/get-started/generate-providers" >}}) quickstart to set up your environment and your Google Cloud project.
2. Ensure that your `magic-modules`, `terraform-provider-google`, and `terraform-provider-google-beta` repositories are up to date.
   ```
   cd ~/magic-modules
   git checkout main && git clean -f . && git checkout -- . && git pull
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google
   git checkout main && git clean -f . && git checkout -- . && git pull
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta
   git checkout main && git clean -f . && git checkout -- . && git pull
   ```

## Add a resource

{{< tabs "resource" >}}
{{< tab "MMv1" >}}
1. Using an editor of your choice, in the appropriate [product folder]({{<ref "/get-started/how-magic-modules-works.md#mmv1" >}}), create a file called `RESOURCE_NAME.yaml`. Replace `RESOURCE_NAME` with the name of the API resource you are adding support for. For example, a configuration file for [NatAddress](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/reference/apis/apigee/rest/v1/organizations.instances.natAddresses) would be called `NatAddress.yaml`.
2. Copy the following template into the new file:

3. Modify the template as needed to match the API resource's documented behavior.
4. Delete all remaining comments in the resource configuration (including attribute descriptions) that were copied from the above template.

> **Note:** The template includes the most commonly-used fields. For a comprehensive reference, see [ResourceName.yaml reference â†—]({{<ref "/reference/resource-reference.md" >}}).
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Handwritten" >}}
> **Warning:** Handwritten resources are more difficult to develop and maintain. New handwritten resources will only be accepted if implementing the resource in MMv1 would require entirely overriding two or more CRUD methods.

1. Add the resource in MMv1.
2. [Generate the beta provider]({{< ref "/get-started/generate-providers.md" >}})
3. From the beta provider, copy the files generated for the resource to the following locations:
   - Resource: Copy to the appropriate service folder inside [`magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/tree/main/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services)
   - Documentation: [`magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/website/docs/r`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/tree/main/mmv1/third_party/terraform/website/docs/r)
   - Tests: Copy to the appropriate service folder inside [`magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/tree/main/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services), and remove `_generated` from the filename
   - Sweepers: [`magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/utils`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/tree/main/mmv1/third_party/terraform/utils)
4. Modify the Go code as needed.
   - Replace all occurrences of `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta/google-beta` with `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/google`
   - Remove the `Example` suffix from all test function names.
   - Remove the comments at the top of the file.
   - If beta-only fields are being tested, do the following:
     - Change the file suffix to `.go.erb`
     - Add `<% autogen_exception -%>` to the top of the file
     - Wrap each beta-only test in a separate version guard: `<% unless version == 'ga' -%>...<% else -%>...<% end -%>`
5. Register the resource in [`magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/utils/provider.go.erb`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/blob/main/mmv1/third_party/terraform/utils/provider.go.erb) under "START handwritten resources"
   - Add a version guard for any beta-only resources.
6. Optional: Complete other handwritten tasks that require the MMv1 configuration file.
    - [Add resource tests]({{< ref "/develop/test.md" >}})
    - [Add IAM support]({{<ref "#add-iam-support" >}})
7. Delete the MMv1 configuration file.

## Add fields

{{< tabs "fields" >}}
{{< tab "MMv1" >}}
1. For each API field, copy the following template into the resource's `properties` attribute. Be sure to indent appropriately.

```yaml
# Supported types: String, Integer, Boolean, Double, Enum,
# ResourceRef (link to a GCP resource), KeyValuePairs (string -> string map),
# Array, and NestedObject
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
  name: 'API_FIELD_NAME'
  description: |
    MULTILINE_FIELD_DESCRIPTION
  # Marks the field (and any subfields) as beta-only. Ensure a beta version block
  # is present in provider.yaml. Do not use if an ancestor field (or the overall
  # resource) is already marked as beta-only.
  # min_version: beta

  # If true, the field (and any subfields) are considered immutable - that is,
  # only settable on create. If unset or false, the field is still considered
  # immutable if any ancestor field (or the overall resource) is immutable,
  # unless `update_url` is set.
  # immutable: true

  # If set, changes to the field's value trigger a separate call to a specific
  # API method for updating the field's value. The field is not considered
  # immutable even if an ancestor field (or the overall resource) is immutable.
  # Terraform field names enclosed in double curly braces are replaced with the
  # field values from the resource at runtime.
  # update_url: 'projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/resourcenames/{{name}}/setFieldName'

  # If update_url is also set, overrides the verb used to update this specific
  # field. Allowed values: :POST, :PUT, :PATCH. Default: Resource's update_verb
  # (which defaults to :PUT if unset).
  # update_verb: :POST

  # If true, the field is required. If unset or false, the field is optional.
  # required: true

  # If true, the field is output-only - that is, it cannot be configured by the
  # user. If unset or false, the field is configurable.
  # output: true

  # If true, the provider sets the field's value in the resource state based only
  # on the user's configuration. If false or unset, the provider sets the field's
  # value in the resource state based on the API response. Only use this attribute
  # if the field cannot be read from GCP due to either API or provider constraints.
  # ignore_read: true

  # Sets a client-side default value for the field. This should be used if the
  # API has a default value that applies in all cases and is stable. Removing
  # or changing a default value is a breaking change. If unset, the field defaults
  # to an "empty" value (such as zero, false, or an empty string).
  # default_value: DEFAULT_VALUE

  # If true, and the field is either not set or set to an "empty" value (such as
  # zero, false, or empty strings), the provider accepts any value returned from
  # the API as the value for the field. If false, and the field is either not set
  # or set to an "empty" value, the provider treats the field's `default_value`
  # as the value for the field and shows a diff if the API returns any other
  # value for the field. This attribute is useful for complex or
  # frequently-changed API-side defaults, but provides less useful information at
  # plan time than `default_value` and causes the provider to ignore user
  # configurations that explicitly set the field to an "empty" value.
  # `default_from_api` and `send_empty_value` cannot both be true on the same field.
  # default_from_api: true

  # If true, the provider sends "empty" values (such as zero, false, or empty
  # strings) to the API if set explicitly in the user's configuration. If false,
  # "empty" values cause the field to be omitted entirely from the API request.
  # This attribute is useful for fields where the API would behave differently
  # for an "empty" value vs no value for a particular field - for example,
  # boolean fields that have an API-side default of true.
  # `send_empty_value` and `default_from_api` cannot both be true on the same field.
  # send_empty_value: true

  # Specifies a list of fields (excluding the current field) that cannot be
  # specified at the same time as the current field. Must be set separately on
  # all listed fields.
  # conflicts:
  #   - field_one
  #   - nested_object.0.nested_field

  # Specifies a list of fields (including the current field) that cannot be
  # specified at the same time (but at least one of which must be set). Must be
  # set separately on all listed fields.
  # exactly_one_of:
  #   - field_one
  #   - nested_object.0.nested_field

  # Enum only. Sets allowed values as ruby "literal constants" (prefixed with a
  # colon). If the allowed values change frequently, use a String field instead
  # to allow better forwards-compatibility, and link to API documentation
  # stating the current allowed values in the String field's description. Do not
  # include UNSPECIFIED values in this list.
  # values:
  #   - :VALUE_ONE
  #   - :VALUE_TWO

  # Array only. Sets the expected type of the items in the array. Primitives
  # should use the name of the primitive class as a string; other types should
  # define the attributes of the nested type.
  # item_type: Api::Type::String
  # item_type: !ruby/object:Api::Type::Enum
  #   name: 'required but unused'
  #   description: 'required but unused'
  #   values:
  #     - :VALUE_ONE
  #     - :VALUE_TWO

  # NestedObject only. Defines fields nested inside the current field.
  # properties:
  #   - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
  #     name: 'FIELD_NAME'
  #     description: |
  #       MULTI_LINE_FIELD_DESCRIPTION
```
2. Modify the field configuration according to the API documentation and behavior.
3. Delete all remaining comments in the field configuration (including attribute descriptions) that were copied from the above template.

> **Note:** The template includes the most commonly-used fields. For a comprehensive reference, see [Field reference â†—]({{<ref "/reference/field-reference.md" >}}).
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Handwritten" >}}
1. Add the field to the handwritten resource's schema.
   - The new field(s) should mirror the API's structure to ease predictability and maintenance. However, if there is an existing related / similar field in the resource that uses a different convention, follow that convention instead.
   - Enum fields in the API should be represented as `TypeString` in Terraform for forwards-compatibility. Link to the API documentation of allowed values in the field description.
   - Terraform field names should always use [snake case â†—](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).
   - See [Schema Types â†—](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/schemas/schema-types) and [Schema Behaviors â†—](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/schemas/schema-behaviors) for more information about field schemas.
2. Add handling for the new field in the resource's Create method and Update methods.
   - "Expanders" convert Terraform resource data to API request data.
   - For top level fields, add an expander. If the field is set or has changed, call the expander and add the resulting value to the API request.
   - For other fields, add logic to the parent field's expander to add the field to the API request. Use a nested expander for complex logic.
3. Add handling for the new field in the resource's Read method.
   - "Flatteners" convert API response data to Terraform resource data.
   - For top level fields, add a flattener. Call `d.Set()` on the flattened API response value to store it in Terraform state.
   - For other fields, add logic to the parent field's flattener to convert the value from the API response to the Terraform state value. Use a nested flattener for complex logic.
4. If any of the added Go code (including any imports) is beta-only, change the file suffix to `.go.erb` and wrap the beta-only code in a version guard: `<% unless version == 'ga' -%>...<% else -%>...<% end -%>`.
   - Add a new guard rather than adding the field to an existing guard; it is easier to read.

## Add IAM support

This section covers how to add IAM resources in Terraform if they are supported by a particular API resource (indicated by `setIamPolicy` and `getIamPolicy` methods in the API documentation for the resource).

{{< tabs "IAM" >}}
{{< tab "MMv1" >}}
1. Add the following top-level block to `ResourceName.yaml` directly above `parameters`.

```yaml
iam_policy: !ruby/object:Api::Resource::IamPolicy
  # Name of the field on the terraform IAM resources which references
  # the parent resource. Update to match the parent resource's name.
  parent_resource_attribute: 'resource_name'
  # Character preceding setIamPolicy in the full URL for the API method.
  # Usually `:`
  method_name_separator: ':'
  # HTTP method for getIamPolicy. Usually :POST.
  # Allowed values: :GET, :POST. Default: :GET
  fetch_iam_policy_verb: :POST
  # Overrides the HTTP method for setIamPolicy.
  # Allowed values: :POST, :PUT. Default: :POST
  # set_iam_policy_verb: :POST

  # Must match the parent resource's `import_format` (or `self_link` if
  # `import_format` is unset), but with the `parent_resource_attribute`
  # value substituted for the final field.
  import_format: [
    'projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/resourcenames/{{resource_name}}'
  ]
  # Valid IAM role that can be set by generated tests. Default: 'roles/viewer'
  # allowed_iam_role: 'roles/viewer'

  # If IAM conditions are supported, set this attribute to indicate how the
  # conditions should be passed to the API. Allowed values: :QUERY_PARAM,
  # :REQUEST_BODY, :QUERY_PARAM_NESTED. Note: :QUERY_PARAM_NESTED should
  # only be used if the query param field contains a `.`
  # iam_conditions_request_type: :REQUEST_BODY

  # Marks IAM support as beta-only
  # min_version: beta
```

2. Modify the template as needed to match the API resource's documented behavior. These are the most commonly-used fields. For a comprehensive reference, see [IAM policy YAML reference â†—]({{<ref "/reference/iam-policy-reference.md" >}}).
3. Delete all remaining comments in the IAM configuration (including attribute descriptions) that were copied from the above template.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Handwritten" >}}
> **Warning:** IAM support for handwritten resources should be implemented using MMv1. New handwritten IAM resources will only be accepted if they cannot be implemented using MMv1.

### Add support in MMv1

1. Follow the MMv1 directions in [Add the resource]({{<ref "#add-the-resource" >}}) to create a skeleton ResourceName.yaml file for the handwritten resource, but set only the following top-level fields:
   - `name`
   - `description` (required but unused)
   - `base_url` (set to URL of IAM parent resource)
   - `self_link` (set to same value as `base_url`)
   - `id_format` (set to same value as `base_url`)
   - `import_format` (including `base_url` value)
   - `properties`
2. Follow the MMv1 directions in [Add fields]({{<ref "#add-fields" >}}) to add only the fields used by base_url.
3. Follow the MMv1 directions in this section to add IAM support.

### Convert to handwritten (not usually necessary)

1. [Generate the beta provider]({{< ref "/get-started/generate-providers.md" >}})
2. From the beta provider, copy the files generated for the IAM resources to the following locations:
   - Resource: Copy to the appropriate service folder inside [`magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/tree/main/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services)
   - Documentation: [`magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/website/docs/r`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/tree/main/mmv1/third_party/terraform/website/docs/r)
   - Tests: In the appropriate service folder inside [`magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/tree/main/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services)
3. Modify the Go code as needed.
   - Replace all occurrences of `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta/google-beta` with `github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/google`
   - Remove the comments at the top of the file.
   - If any of the added Go code is beta-only:
     - Change the file suffix to `.go.erb`
     - Add `<% autogen_exception -%>` to the top of the file
     - Wrap each beta-only code block (including any imports) in a separate version guard: `<% unless version == 'ga' -%>...<% else -%>...<% end -%>`
4. Register the binding, member, and policy resources in [`magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/utils/provider.go.erb`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/blob/main/mmv1/third_party/terraform/utils/provider.go.erb) under "START non-generated IAM resources"
   - Add a version guard for any beta-only resources.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

## Add documentation

{{< tabs "docs" >}}
{{< tab "MMv1" >}}
Documentation is autogenerated based on the resource and field configurations. To preview the documentation:

1. [Generate the providers]({{< ref "/get-started/generate-providers.md" >}})
2. Copy and paste the generated documentation into the Hashicorp Registry's [Doc Preview Tool](https://registry.terraform.io/tools/doc-preview) to see how it is rendered.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Handwritten" >}}
### Add or modify documentation files

1. Open the resource documentation in [`magic-modules/third_party/terraform/website/docs/r/`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/tree/main/mmv1/third_party/terraform/website/docs/r) using an editor of your choice.
   - The name of the file is the name of the resource without a `google_` prefix. For example, for `google_compute_instance`, the file is called `compute_instance.html.markdown`
2. Modify the documentation as needed according to [Handwritten documentation style guide]({{< ref "/develop/handwritten-docs-style-guide" >}}).
3. [Generate the providers]({{< ref "/get-started/generate-providers.md" >}})
4. Copy and paste the generated documentation into the Hashicorp Registry's [Doc Preview Tool](https://registry.terraform.io/tools/doc-preview) to see how it is rendered.

## What's next?

- [Add custom resource code]({{< ref "/develop/custom-code.md" >}})
- [Add tests]({{< ref "/develop/test.md" >}})
- [Run tests]({{< ref "/develop/run-tests.md" >}})
