# Best practices

The following is a list of best practices that contributions are expected to follow in order to ensure a consistent UX for the Terraform provider for Google Cloud internally and also compared to other Terraform providers.

## ForceNew

[`ForceNew`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro#how-does-terraform-work) in a Terraform resource schema attribute that indicates that a field is immutable â€“ that is, that a change to the field requires the resource to be destroyed and recreated.

This is necessary and required for cases where a field can't be updated in-place, so that [Terraform's core workflow](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro#how-does-terraform-work) of aligning real infrastructure with configuration can be achieved. If a field or resource can never be updated in-place and is not marked with `ForceNew`, that is considered a bug in the provider.

Some fields or resources may be possible to update in place, but only under specific conditions. In these cases, you can treat the field as updatable - that is, do not mark it as ForceNew; instead, implement standard update functionality. Then, call `diff.ForceNew` inside a [`CustomizeDiff`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/customizing-differences) if the appropriate conditions to allow update in place are not met. Any `CustomizeDiff` function like this must be thoroughly unit tested. Making a field conditionally updatable like this is considered a good and useful enhancement in cases where recreation is costly and conditional updates do not introduce undue complexity.

In complex cases, it is better to mark the field `ForceNew` to ensure that users can apply their configurations successfully.

### Mitigating data loss risk via deletion_protection

Some resources, such as databases, have a significant risk of unrecoverable data loss if the resource is accidentally deleted due to a change to a ForceNew field. For these resources, the best practice is to add a `deletion_protection` field that defaults to `true`, which prevents the resource from being deleted if enabled. Although it is a small breaking change, for users, the benefits of `deletion_protection` defaulting to `true` outweigh the cost.

APIs also sometimes add `deletion_protection` fields, which will generally default to `false` for backwards-compatibility reasons. Any `deletion_protection` API field added to an existing Terraform resource must match the API default initially. The default may be set to `true` in the next major release. For new Terraform resources, any `deletion_protection` field should default to `true` in Terraform regardless of the API default. When creating the corresponding Terraform field, the name
should match the API field name (i.e. it need not literally be named `deletion_protection` if the API uses something different) and should be the same field type (example: if the API field is an enum, so should the Terraform field).

A resource can have up to two `deletion_protection` fields (with different names): one that represents a field in the API, and one that is only in Terraform. This could happen because the API added its field after `deletion_protection` already existed in Terraform; it could also happen because a separate field was added in Terraform to make sure that `deletion_protection` is enabled by default. In either case, they should be reconciled into a single field (that defaults to enabled and whose name matches the API field) in the next major release.

Resources that do not have a significant risk of unrecoverable data loss or similar critical concern will not be given `deletion_protection` fields.

**Note:** The previous best practice was a field called `force_delete` that defaulted to `false`. This is still present on some resources for backwards-compatibility reasons, but `deletion_protection` is preferred going forward.

## Deletion policy

Some resources need to let users control the actions taken add deletion time. For these resources, the best practice is to add a `deletion_policy` enum field that defaults to an empty string and allows special values that control the deletion behavior.

One common example is `ABANDON`, which is useful if the resource is safe to delete from Terraform but could cause problems if deleted from the API - for example, `google_bigtable_gc_policy` deletion can fail in replicated instances. `ABANDON` indicates that attempts to delete the resource should remove it from state without actually deleting it.

See [magic-modules#13107](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/pull/13107) for an example of adding a `deletion_policy` field to an existing resource.

## Add labels and annotations support

The new labels model and the new annotations model are introduced in [Terraform provider for Google Cloud 5.0.0](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/version_5_upgrade#provider).

There are now three label-related fields with the new labels model:
* The `labels` field is now non-authoritative and only manages the label keys defined in your configuration for the resource.
* The `terraform_labels` cannot be specified directly by the user. It merges the labels defined in the resource's configuration and the default labels configured in the provider block. If the same label key exists on both the resource level and provider level, the value on the resource will override the provider-level default.
* The output-only `effective_labels` will list all the labels present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, the system, and other clients.

There are now two annotation-related fields with the new annotations model:
* The `annotations` field is now non-authoritative and only manages the annotation keys defined in your configuration for the resource.
* The output-only `effective_annotations` will list all the annotations present on the resource in GCP, including the annotations configured through Terraform, the system, and other clients.

This document describes how to add `labels` and `annotations` field to resources to support the new models.

### Labels support
When adding a new `labels` field, please make the changes below to support the new labels model. Otherwise, it has to wait for the next major release to make the changes.

#### MMv1 resources

1. Use the type `KeyValueLabels` for the standard resource `labels` field. The standard resource `labels` field could be the top level `labels` field or the nested `labels` field inside the top level `metadata` field. Don't add `default_from_api: true` to this field or don't use this type for other `labels` fields in the resource. `KeyValueLabels` will add all of changes required for the new model automatically.

```yaml
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::KeyValueLabels
   name: 'labels'
   description: |
   The labels associated with this dataset. You can use these to
   organize and group your datasets.
```
2. In the handwritten acceptance tests, add `labels` and `terraform_labels` to `ImportStateVerifyIgnore` if `labels` field is in the configuration.

```go
ImportStateVerifyIgnore: []string{"labels", "terraform_labels"}, 
```
3. In the corresponding data source, after the resource read method, call the function `tpgresource.SetDataSourceLabels(d)` to make `labels` and `terraform_labels` have all of the labels on the resource.

```go
err = resourceArtifactRegistryRepositoryRead(d, meta)
if err != nil {
   return err
}

if err := tpgresource.SetDataSourceLabels(d); err != nil {
   return err
}
```

#### Handwritten resources

1. Add `tpgresource.SetLabelsDiff`  to `CustomizeDiff` of the resource.
```go
CustomizeDiff: customdiff.All(
   tpgresource.SetLabelsDiff,
),
```
2. Add `labels` field and add more attributes (such as `ForceNew: true,`, `Set: schema.HashString,`) to this field if necessary.
```go
"labels": {
   Type:     schema.TypeMap,
   Optional: true,
   Elem:     &schema.Schema{Type: schema.TypeString},
   Description: `A set of key/value label pairs to assign to the project.
   
   **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
   Please refer to the field 'effective_labels' for all of the labels present on the resource.`,
},
```
3. Add output only field `terraform_labels` and add more attributes (such as `Set: schema.HashString,`) to this field if necessary. Don't add `ForceNew:true,` to this field.
```go
"terraform_labels": {
   Type:        schema.TypeMap,
   Computed:    true,
   Description: `The combination of labels configured directly on the resource and default labels configured on the provider.`,
   Elem:        &schema.Schema{Type: schema.TypeString},
},
```
4. Add output only field `effective_labels` and add more attributes (such as `ForceNew: true,`, `Set: schema.HashString,`) to this field if necessary.
```go
"effective_labels": {
   Type:        schema.TypeMap,
   Computed:    true,
   Description: `All of labels (key/value pairs) present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, other clients and services.`,
   Elem:        &schema.Schema{Type: schema.TypeString},
},
```
5. In the create method, use the value of `effective_labels` in API request.
6. In the update method, use the value of `effective_labels` in API request.
7. In the read mehtod, set `labels`, `terraform_labels` and `effective_labels` to state.
```go
if err := tpgresource.SetLabels(res.Labels, d, "labels"); err != nil {
   return fmt.Errorf("Error setting labels: %s", err)
}
if err := tpgresource.SetLabels(res.Labels, d, "terraform_labels"); err != nil {
   return fmt.Errorf("Error setting terraform_labels: %s", err)
}
if err := d.Set("effective_labels", res.Labels); err != nil {
   return fmt.Errorf("Error setting effective_labels: %s", err)
}
```
8. In the handwritten acceptance tests, add `labels` and `terraform_labels` to `ImportStateVerifyIgnore`.
9. In the corresponding data source, after the resource read method, call the function `tpgresource.SetDataSourceLabels(d)` to make `labels` and `terraform_labels` have all of the labels on the resource.
10. Add the documentation for these label-related fields.

### Annotations support
When adding a new `annotations` field, please make the changes below below to support the new annotations model. Otherwise, it has to wait for the next major release to make the breaking changes.

#### MMv1 resources

1. Use the type `KeyValueAnnotations` for the standard resource `annotations` field. The standard resource `annotations` field could be the top level `annotations` field or the nested `annotations` field inside the top level `metadata` field. Don't add `default_from_api: true` to this field or don't use this type for other `annotations` fields in the resource. `KeyValueAnnotations` will add all of changes required for the new model automatically.

```yaml
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::KeyValueAnnotations
   name: 'annotations'
   description: 'Client-specified annotations. This is distinct from labels.'
```
2. In the handwritten acceptance tests, add `annotations` to `ImportStateVerifyIgnore` if `annotations` field is in the configuration.

```go
ImportStateVerifyIgnore: []string{"annotations"},
```
3. In the corresponding data source, after the resource read method, call the function `tpgresource.SetDataSourceAnnotations(d)` to make `annotations` have all of the annotations on the resource.

```go
err = resourceSecretManagerSecretRead(d, meta)
if err != nil {
   return err
}

if err := tpgresource.SetDataSourceLabels(d); err != nil {
   return err
}

if err := tpgresource.SetDataSourceAnnotations(d); err != nil {
   return err
}
```

#### Handwritten resources

1. Add `tpgresource.SetAnnotationsDiff`  to `CustomizeDiff` of the resource.
2. Add `annotations` field and add more attributes (such as `ForceNew: true,`, `Set: schema.HashString,`) to this field if necessary.
3. Add output only field `effective_annotations` and add more attributes (such as `ForceNew: true,`, `Set: schema.HashString,`) to this field if necessary.
4. In the create method, use the value of `effective_annotations` in API request.
5. In the update method, use the value of `effective_annotations` in API request.
6. In the read mehtod, set `annotations`, and `effective_annotations` to state.
7. In the handwritten acceptance tests, add `annotations` to `ImportStateVerifyIgnore`.
8. In the corresponding data source, after the resource read method, call the function `tpgresource.SetDataSourceAnnotations(d)` to make `annotations` have all of the labels on the resource.
9. Add the documentation for these annotation-related fields.

## Update `go.mod`

The Magic Modules repository does not contain a complete Go module, preventing the use of automated tooling like `go get` from that repository. To add or update provider dependencies, use standard Go tooling to update an individual provider and copy the results to the upstream files in Magic Modules. The providers share the same go.mod and go.sum contents so either can be used to generate the changes.

Below are the steps you can follow to make the change:

1. Navigate to the local `google` provider directory:
```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google
``` 
2. Open the [`go.mod`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/blob/main/go.mod) file and add the new entries or modify the versions of existing entries as needed
3. Update dependencies using either of the following methods
   * run the following commands to update all dependencies: 
   ```bash
   go get
   go mod tidy
   ```
   * Alternatively, update a specific package to a desired version:
   ```bash
   go get google.golang.org/api@v0.105.0 
   go mod tidy
   ```
4. Copy the contents of the updated `go.mod` and `go.sum` file into [`mmv1/third_party/terraform/go.mod.erb`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/blob/main/mmv1/third_party/terraform/go.mod.erb) and [`mmv1/third_party/terraform/go.sum`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/blob/main/mmv1/third_party/terraform/go.sum) in the `magic-modules` respectively. Ensure `<% autogen_exception -%>` is still at the top of the file afterwards
