# Module Philosophy

There are various processors out there that ingest a manifest and produce a
client library. You can get client libraries for Java, Ruby, .NET, etc. However,
for deployment tools a library is not enough. _These tools do not care about an
abstraction layer because they are not a scripting languages_.

## Convergence To Desired State

Our modules care about converging objects from any state into a final desired
state specified by the administrator. The administrator declares their intent
in a product specific DSL, and the infrastructure is supposed to make it happen.
For example consider that the administrator declared:

```puppet
gcompute_instance { 'my-middle-tier-vm':
  ensure => running,
  zone   => 'us-central1-a',
}
```

If the machine is not running, the infrastructure is supposed to make it
happen: start if stopped, resume if paused, restore if archived. Also if the
machine is not on the `us-central1-a` zone, it should move it there. If something
described above cannot be accomplished the tool will fail with a clear and
actionable message of why it failed and what the administrator needs to do to
correct the issue.

## Idempotency

Unlike scripting languages, declarative tools (like Chef or Puppet) specify
intent and the system's final behavior. So that means if the system is already
in the desired state nothing should happen or be changed, or attempted to be
changed, _even if the final result is the same_.

Consider the following bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
apt-get install apache2
cp my-template.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/25-mysite.conf
chmod 644 /etc/httpd/conf.d/25-mysite.conf
chattr -i /etc/httpd/conf.d/25-mysite.conf
```

In the simple script above we're installing Apache, copying our site
definitions and protecting the file. _Note that you cannot run that script
twice without it failing_ as `chattr` prevents the next `cp` to work. Also note that
if `apache2` is already installed, although apt-get will not attempt to install
it again, the full `apt-get` install process will happen again. For example,
catalog being updated or cleaned, block until another installation is in
progress, add installation to system log, etc.

So if you do the following in Puppet:

```puppet
package { 'apache2':
  ensure => installed,
}

file { '/etc/httpd/conf.d/25-mysite.conf':
  ensure => file,
  mode   => '0644',
}

chattr::attribute_add { '/etc/httpd/conf.d/25-mysite.conf':
  attribute => 'i',
  require   => File['/etc/httpd/conf.d/25-mysite.conf'],
}
```

Puppet/Chef will not attempt to start installing `apache2` if it is already there
(`apt-get` will not even be called). Similarly if the properties of the
configuration file are correct (mode, immutability bit, etc) Puppet/Chef will
not attempt to change anything. This leads to a cleaner execution.
