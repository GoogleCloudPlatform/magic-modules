                DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be
                deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is
                requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The
                resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists,
                and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
                finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items,
                deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not
                be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or
                the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may
                request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by
                sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After
                that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL)
                to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the
                presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this
                timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
                resource is fully terminated.
                If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

                Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.

                GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a
                unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is
                used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name
                passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided
                value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated
                by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the
                server.

                If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
                NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with
                Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the
                time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time
                indicated in the Retry-After header).

                        DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be
                        deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is
                        requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The
                        resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists,
                        and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
                        finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items,
                        deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not
                        be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or
                        the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may
                        request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by
                        sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After
                        that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL)
                        to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the
                        presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this
                        timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
                        resource is fully terminated.
                        If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

                        used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name
                        passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided
                        value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated
                        by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the
                        server.

                        If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
                        NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with
                        Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the
                        time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time

                                      live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy.
