          description: 'Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for
            organizing cloud resources into groups that reflect a customer''s organizational
            needs and deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections
            of resources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated.
            And they can be used as arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route,
            firewall, load balancing, etc.).   * Label keys must be between 1 and
            63 characters long and must conform to    the following regular expression:
            `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`.  * Label values must be between 0 and 63
            characters long and must conform    to the regular expression `([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)?`.  *
            No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource.  See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf
            for more information on and examples of labels.  If you plan to use labels
            in your own code, please note that additional characters may be allowed
            in the future. And so you are advised to use an internal label representation,
            such as JSON, which doesn''t rely upon specific characters being disallowed.  For
            example, representing labels as the string:  name + "_" + value  would
            prove problematic if we were to allow "_" in a future release.'
