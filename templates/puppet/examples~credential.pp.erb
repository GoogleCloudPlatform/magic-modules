# Getting Started
# ---------------
# The following example requires two environment variables to be set:
#     * cred_path - a path to a JSON service account file
#     * project - the name of your GCP project
#
# If running from the command line you can pass these via Facter:
#
#   FACTER_cred_path=/path/to/my/cred.json \
#   FACTER_project='my-test-project'
#       puppet apply <%= file_relative %>
#
# For convenience you optionally can add it to your ~/.bash_profile (or the
# respective .profile settings) environment:
#
#   export FACTER_cred_path=/path/to/my/cred.json
#   export FACTER_project='my-test-project'
#
# Authenticating to GCP
# ---------------------
# `gauth_credential` defines a credential to be used when communicating with
# Google Cloud Platform.
#
# For more information on the gauth_credential parameters and providers please
# refer to its detailed documentation at:
#
#   https://forge.puppet.com/google/gauth
#
