// The BackendService API's Update / PUT API is badly formed and behaves like
// a PATCH field for at least IAP. When sent a `null` `iap` field, the API
// doesn't disable an existing field. To work around this, we need to emulate
// the old Terraform behaviour of always sending the block (at both update and
// create), and force sending each subfield as empty when the block isn't
// present in config.
