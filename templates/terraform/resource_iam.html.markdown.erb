<%# NOTE NOTE NOTE
    The newlines in this file are *load bearing*.  This file outputs
    Markdown, which is extremely sensitive to newlines.  You have got
    to have a newline after every attribute and property, because
    otherwise MD will think the next element is part of the previous
    property's bullet point.  You cannot have any double newlines in the
    middle of a property or attribute, because MD will think that the
    empty line ends the bullet point and the indentation will be off.
    You must have a newline before and after all --- document indicators,
    and you must have a newline before and after all - - - hlines.
    You cannot have more than one blank line between properties.
    The --- document indicator must be the first line of the file.
    As long as you only use `build_property_documentation`, it all works
    fine - but when you need to add custom docs (notes, etc), you need
    to remember these things.

    Know also that the `lines` function in heavy use in MagicModules will
    strip exactly one trailing newline - unless that's what you've designed
    your docstring for, it's easier to insert newlines where you need them
    manually.  That's why, in this file, we use `lines` on anything which
    is generated from a ruby function, but skip it on anything that is
    directly inserted from YAML.

  Collection of resources to manage IAM policy for <%= "#{product_ns}#{object.name}" %>
---

# IAM policy for <%= "#{product_ns}#{object.name}" %>
Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for <%= product_ns -%> <%= object.name -%>. Each of these resources serves a different use case:

* `<%= terraform_name -%>_policy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the <%= object.name.downcase -%> and replaces any existing policy already attached.
* `<%= terraform_name -%>_binding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the <%= object.name.downcase -%> are preserved.
* `<%= terraform_name -%>_member`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the <%= object.name.downcase -%> are preserved.

~> **Note:** `<%= terraform_name -%>_policy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `<%= terraform_name -%>_binding` and `<%= terraform_name -%>_member` or they will fight over what your policy should be.

~> **Note:** `<%= terraform_name -%>_binding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `<%= terraform_name -%>_member` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

<% if object.min_version.name == 'beta' -%>
~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

## <%= markdown_escaped_name -%>\_binding

  <%= object.name.underscore -%> = "<%= object.id_format.gsub('{{name}}', "{{#{object.name.underscore}}}")-%>"

  role   = "roles/editor"
  member = "user:jane@example.com"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `<%= object.name.downcase -%>` - (Required) The <%= object.name.downcase -%> name or id to bind to attach IAM policy to.

* `project` - (Optional) The project in which the resource belongs. If it
    is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `member/members` - (Required) Identities that will be granted the privilege in `role`.
  Each entry can have one of the following values:
  * **allUsers**: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account.
  * **allAuthenticatedUsers**: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.
  * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@gmail.com or joe@example.com.
  * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com.
  * **group:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com.
  * **domain:{domain}**: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias) name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com.

* `role` - (Required) The role that should be applied. Only one
    `<%= terraform_name -%>_binding` can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
    `[projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}`.

* `policy_data` - (Required only by `<%= terraform_name -%>_policy`) The policy data generated by
  a `google_iam_policy` data source.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the <%= object.name.downcase -%>'s IAM policy.

## Import

<%= product_ns -%> <%= object.name.downcase -%> IAM resources can be imported using the project, <%= object.name.downcase -%> name, role and member.

```
$ terraform import <%= terraform_name -%>_policy.editor <%= object.id_format.gsub('{{name}}', "{{#{object.name.underscore}}}") -%>

$ terraform import <%= terraform_name -%>_binding.editor "<%= object.id_format.gsub('{{name}}', "{{#{object.name.underscore}}}") -%> roles/editor"

$ terraform import <%= terraform_name -%>_member.editor "<%= object.id_format.gsub('{{name}}', "{{#{object.name.underscore}}}") -%> roles/editor jane@example.com"
```

-> If you're importing a resource with beta features, make sure to include `-provider=google-beta`
as an argument so that Terraform uses the correct provider to import your resource.
