# This script takes in 'magic-modules-branched', a git repo tracking the head of a PR against magic-modules.
# It outputs "terraform-diff/${SHORT_NAME}_comment.txt"

# The vast majority of this file is a direct copy of generate-terraform.sh.  We could factor out all that
# code into a shared library, but I don't think we need to do that.  This is an inherently temporary file,
# until TPG 3.0.0 is released, which is in the relatively near future.  The cost of the copy is that
# we need to maintain both files - but the last change to that file was several months ago and I expect
# we're looking at 1 - 2 changes that need to be made in both places.  The cost of not copying it is
# an extra few hours of work now, and some minor readability issues.

    # "find .": all files and directories recursively under the current directory, subject to matchers.
    # "-type f": all regular real files, i.e. not directories.
    # "-not": do the opposite of the next thing, always used with another matcher.
    # "-wholename": entire relative path - including directory names - matches following wildcard.
    # "-name": filename alone matches following string.  e.g. -name README.md matches ./README.md *and* ./foo/bar/README.md
    # "-exec": for each file found, execute the command following until the literal ';'
