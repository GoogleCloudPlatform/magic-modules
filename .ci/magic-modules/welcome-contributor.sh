Hello!  I am a robot who works on Magic Modules PRs.

I have detected that you are a community contributor, so your PR will be assigned to someone with a commit-bit on this repo for initial review.  They will authorize it to run through our CI pipeline, which will generate downstream PRs.

Thanks for your contribution!  A human will be with you soon.

@$ASSIGNEE, please review this PR or find an appropriate assignee.

# Something is preventing the magician from actually assigning the PRs.
# Leave this part in so we know what was supposed to happen, but the real
