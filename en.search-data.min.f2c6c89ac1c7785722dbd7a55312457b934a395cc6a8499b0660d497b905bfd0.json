For example: If you are adding multiple resources to the provider, only put one resource in each PR - even if the product requires all resources to be present before it can be meaningfully used. If you are adding a few fields and also fixing a bug, create one PR for adding the new fields and a separate PR for the bugs. Follow the instructions at Creating a pull request to create a pull request to merge your branch into GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules. Make sure the PR body includes the text Fixes GITHUB_ISSUE_LINK. once per issue resolved by your PR. Replace GITHUB_ISSUE_LINK with a link to a GitHub issue from the provider issue tracker. Write release notes Code review # A reviewer will automatically be assigned to your PR. Creating a new pull request or pushing a new commit automatically triggers our CI pipelines and workflows. After CI starts, downstream diff generation takes about 10 minutes; VCR tests can take up to 2 hours. If you are a community contributor, some tests will only run after approval from a reviewer. If your assigned reviewer does not respond to changes on a pull request within two US business days, ping them on the pull request. TIP: Speeding up review:\nResolve failed status checks quickly Ask your reviewer for help if you get stuck. Self-review your PR or ask someone you know to review Troubleshoot status check failures # Provider unit tests or VCR tests # VCR test failures that do not immediately seem related to your PR are most likely safe to ignore unless your reviewer says otherwise.\nReview the \u0026ldquo;diff generation\u0026rdquo; report to make sure the generated code looks as expected. Check out the generated code for your PR to run tests and iterate locally.

Magic Modules uses that mapping (and additional handwritten code where necessary) to generate \u0026ldquo;downstream\u0026rdquo; repositories - in particular, the Terraform providers for Google Platform: google (or TPG) and google-beta (or TPGB).\nGeneration of the downstream repositories happens for every new commit in a PR (to a temporary branch owned by the modular-magician robot user) and on every merge into the main branch (to the main branch of downstreams). Generation for PR commits allows contributors to manually examine the changes, as well as allowing automatic running of unit tests, acceptance tests, and automated checks such as breaking change detection.\nResource types # There are three types of resources supported by Magic Modules: MMv1, Handwritten, and DCL/tpgtools. These are described in more detail in the following sections.\nMMv1 # MMv1 consists of a set of \u0026ldquo;products\u0026rdquo;; each product contains one or more \u0026ldquo;resources\u0026rdquo;.\nEach product has a folder in magic-modules/mmv1/products. The name of the folder is the \u0026ldquo;product name\u0026rdquo;, which usually corresponds to the API subdomain covered by the product (such as compute.googleapis.com). Each product folder contains a product configuration file (product.yaml) and one or more resource configuration files (ResourceName.yaml). The actual name of a ResourceName.yaml file usually matches the name of a GCP API resource in the product\u0026rsquo;s subdomain.\nMMv1 resource configurations may reference handwritten code stored in magic-modules/mmv1/templates/terraform, which will be injected into the generated resource file. Many MMv1 resources also have one or more handwritten tests, which are stored in the appropriate service folder inside magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services\nIn the providers, MMv1-based resources are stored in PROVIDER/services/PRODUCT/resource_PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go, where PROVIDER is google or google-beta, PRODUCT is the product name, and RESOURCE is the GCP API resource\u0026rsquo;s name converted to snake case ↗.\nMMv1-based files start with the following header:\n*** AUTO GENERATED CODE *** Type: MMv1 *** Handwritten # Handwritten resources and datasources are technically part of MMv1; however, they are not generated from YAML configurations. Instead, they are written as Go code with minimal ruby \u0026ldquo;version guards\u0026rdquo; to exclude beta-only features from the google provider.\nHandwritten resources and datasources can be grouped by \u0026ldquo;service\u0026rdquo;, which generally corresponds to the API subdomain the resource or datasource interacts with.\nIn addition to the core implementation, handwritten resources and datasources will also have documentation, tests, and sweepers (which clean up stray resources left behind by tests). Each type of code is stored in the following locations:\nResource \u0026amp; datasource implementation: In the appropriate service folder inside magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services Resource documentation: magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/website/docs/r Datasource documentation: magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/website/docs/d Tests: In the appropriate service folder inside magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services Sweepers: magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/utils In the providers, handwritten resources and datasources are stored in PROVIDER/services/SERVICE/FILENAME.go, where PROVIDER is google or google-beta, SERVICE is the service name, and FILENAME is the name of the handwritten file in magic-modules. Handwritten files do not have an AUTO GENERATED CODE header.\nDCL aka tpgtools (maintenance mode) # DCL / tpgtools is similar to MMv1; however, it is in maintenance mode, which means that new resources using the DCL are not being added.\nDCL-based files start with the following header:\n*** AUTO GENERATED CODE *** Type: DCL *** "},{"id":6,"href":"/magic-modules/reference/resource-reference/","title":"Resource YAML reference ↗","section":"Reference","content":"FORCE MENU RENDER\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/magic-modules/contribute/release-notes/","title":"Write release notes","section":"Contribute","content":" Write release notes # This guide explains best practices for composing accurate, end-user focused release notes for Magic Modules pull requests.\nEvery pull request must have at least one release note block in the opening comment. Release note blocks have the following format:\n```release-note:TYPE CONTENT ``` Replace TYPE with the correct release note type, and CONTENT with a release note written according to the guidelines in the following sections.\nGeneral guidelines # Do Don\u0026rsquo;t Only have one CONTENT line per release note block. Use multiple blocks if there are multiple related changes in a single PR. Don\u0026rsquo;t add multiple lines to a single release note block. Avoid combining multiple distinct types of changes into one release block. If a change only affects the google-beta provider add (beta) to the end of the release note. If a change only affects the google provider add (ga) to the end of the release note. Don\u0026rsquo;t add either suffix if the change affects both providers. Set an appropriate release note type. Don\u0026rsquo;t leave the type as REPLACEME. Type-specific guidelines and examples # New field(s) Write your release note in the following format:\n```release-note:enhancement PRODUCT: added `FIELD_1`, `FIELD_2`, and `FIELD_N` fields to `RESOURCE_NAME` resource ``` Replace PRODUCT, FIELD_*, and RESOURCE_NAME according to the pull request content. For example:\n```release-note:enhancement compute: added `foo_bar` field to `google_compute_foo` resource ``` New resource Write your release note in the following format:\n```release-note:new-resource `RESOURCE_NAME` ``` Replace RESOURCE_NAME according to the pull request content. For example:\n```release-note:new-resource `google_compute_new_resource` ``` New datasource Write your release note in the following format:\n```release-note:new-datasource `DATASOURCE_NAME` ``` Replace DATASOURCE_NAME according to the pull request content. For example:\n```release-note:new-datasource `google_compute_new_datasource` ``` Other Choose a release note type # For each release note block, choose an appropriate type from the following list:\nenhancement : New features on existing resources bug : Bug fix deprecation : A field/resource is being marked as deprecated (not being removed) breaking-change : Changes that require users to change their configuration note : General type for other notes that might be relevant to users but don\u0026rsquo;t fit into another category none : Changes where there is no user impact, like test fixes, website updates and CI changes. Release notes of this type should be empty. Guidelines # Do Don\u0026rsquo;t Use past tense to describe the end state after the change is released. Start with a verb. For example, \u0026ldquo;added\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;fixed\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;resolved\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. You can use future tense to describe future changes, such as saying that a deprecated field will be removed in a future version. Don\u0026rsquo;t use present or future tense to describe changes that are included in the pull request. Write user-focused release notes. For example, reference specific impacted terraform resource and field names, and discuss changes in behavior users will experience. Avoid API field/resource/feature names. Avoid implementation details. Avoid language that requires understanding of provider internals. Surround resource or field names with backticks. Don\u0026rsquo;t use resource or field names without punctuation or with other punctuation like quotation marks. Use impersonal third person. Don\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo;, etc. If the pull request impacts any specific, begin your release note with that product name followed by a colon. Use lower case for the first letter after the colon. For example, cloudrun: added... For MMv1 resources, use the folder name that contains the yaml files as the product name; for handwritten or tpgtools resources, use the API subdomain; for broad cross-product changes, use provider. Don\u0026rsquo;t begin your release note with the full resource name. Don\u0026rsquo;t add backticks around the product name. Don\u0026rsquo;t capitalize the first letter after the colon. Examples # ```release-note:bug cloudrun: fixed perma-diff in `google_cloud_run_service` ``` ```release-note:deprecation container: deprecated `region` and `zone` on `google_container_unicorn`. Use `location` instead. ``` "},{"id":8,"href":"/magic-modules/best-practices/","title":"Best practices","section":"Overview","content":" Best practices # The following is a list of best practices that contributions are expected to follow in order to ensure a consistent UX for the Google Terraform provider internally and also compared to other Terraform providers.\nForceNew # ForceNew in a Terraform resource schema attribute that indicates that a field is immutable – that is, that a change to the field requires the resource to be destroyed and recreated.\nThis is necessary and required for cases where a field can\u0026rsquo;t be updated in-place, so that Terraform\u0026rsquo;s core workflow of aligning real infrastructure with configuration can be achieved. If a field or resource can never be updated in-place and is not marked with ForceNew, that is considered a bug in the provider.\nSome fields or resources may be possible to update in place, but only under specific conditions. In these cases, you can treat the field as updatable - that is, do not mark it as ForceNew; instead, implement standard update functionality. Then, call diff.ForceNew inside a CustomizeDiff if the appropriate conditions to allow update in place are not met. Any CustomizeDiff function like this must be thoroughly unit tested. Making a field conditionally updatable like this is considered a good and useful enhancement in cases where recreation is costly and conditional updates do not introduce undue complexity.\nIn complex cases, it is better to mark the field ForceNew to ensure that users can apply their configurations successfully.\nMitigating data loss risk via deletion_protection # Some resources, such as databases, have a significant risk of unrecoverable data loss if the resource is accidentally deleted due to a change to a ForceNew field. For these resources, the best practice is to add a deletion_protection field that defaults to true, which prevents the resource from being deleted if enabled. Although it is a small breaking change, for users, the benefits of deletion_protection defaulting to true outweigh the cost.\nAPIs also sometimes add deletion_protection fields, which will generally default to false for backwards-compatibility reasons. Any deletion_protection API field added to an existing Terraform resource must match the API default initially. The default may be set to true in the next major release. For new Terraform resources, any deletion_protection field should default to true in Terraform regardless of the API default. When creating the corresponding Terraform field, the name should match the API field name (i.e. it need not literally be named deletion_protection if the API uses something different) and should be the same field type (example: if the API field is an enum, so should the Terraform field).\nA resource can have up to two deletion_protection fields (with different names): one that represents a field in the API, and one that is only in Terraform. This could happen because the API added its field after deletion_protection already existed in Terraform; it could also happen because a separate field was added in Terraform to make sure that deletion_protection is enabled by default. In either case, they should be reconciled into a single field (that defaults to enabled and whose name matches the API field) in the next major release.\nResources that do not have a significant risk of unrecoverable data loss or similar critical concern will not be given deletion_protection fields.\nNote: The previous best practice was a field called force_delete that defaulted to false. This is still present on some resources for backwards-compatibility reasons, but deletion_protection is preferred going forward. Deletion policy # Some resources need to let users control the actions taken add deletion time. For these resources, the best practice is to add a deletion_policy enum field that defaults to an empty string and allows special values that control the deletion behavior.\nOne common example is ABANDON, which is useful if the resource is safe to delete from Terraform but could cause problems if deleted from the API - for example, google_bigtable_gc_policy deletion can fail in replicated instances. ABANDON indicates that attempts to delete the resource should remove it from state without actually deleting it.\nSee magic-modules#13107 for an example of adding a deletion_policy field to an existing resource.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/magic-modules/develop/resource/","title":"Add or modify a resource","section":"Develop","content":" Add or modify a resource # This page describes how to add a new resource to the google or google-beta Terraform provider using MMv1 and/or handwritten code.\nFor more information about types of resources and the generation process overall, see How Magic Modules works.\nBefore you begin # Complete the Generate the providers quickstart to set up your environment and your Google Cloud project.

If false, and the field is either not set # or set to an \u0026#34;empty\u0026#34; value, the provider treats the field\u0026#39;s `default_value` # as the value for the field and shows a diff if the API returns any other # value for the field. This attribute is useful for complex or # frequently-changed API-side defaults, but provides less useful information at # plan time than `default_value` and causes the provider to ignore user # configurations that explicitly set the field to an \u0026#34;empty\u0026#34; value. # `default_from_api` and `send_empty_value` cannot both be true on the same field. # default_from_api: true # If true, the provider sends \u0026#34;empty\u0026#34; values (such as zero, false, or empty # strings) to the API if set explicitly in the user\u0026#39;s configuration.

For a comprehensive reference, see Field reference ↗.\nHandwritten Add the field to the handwritten resource\u0026rsquo;s schema. The new field(s) should mirror the API\u0026rsquo;s structure to ease predictability and maintenance. However, if there is an existing related / similar field in the resource that uses a different convention, follow that convention instead. Enum fields in the API should be represented as TypeString in Terraform for forwards-compatibility. Link to the API documentation of allowed values in the field description. Terraform field names should always use snake case ↗. See Schema Types ↗ and Schema Behaviors ↗ for more information about field schemas. Add handling for the new field in the resource\u0026rsquo;s Create method and Update methods. \u0026ldquo;Expanders\u0026rdquo; convert Terraform resource data to API request data. For top level fields, add an expander. If the field is set or has changed, call the expander and add the resulting value to the API request. For other fields, add logic to the parent field\u0026rsquo;s expander to add the field to the API request. Use a nested expander for complex logic. Add handling for the new field in the resource\u0026rsquo;s Read method. \u0026ldquo;Flatteners\u0026rdquo; convert API response data to Terraform resource data. For top level fields, add a flattener. Call d.Set() on the flattened API response value to store it in Terraform state. For other fields, add logic to the parent field\u0026rsquo;s flattener to convert the value from the API response to the Terraform state value. Use a nested flattener for complex logic. If any of the added Go code (including any imports) is beta-only, change the file suffix to .go.erb and wrap the beta-only code in a version guard: \u0026lt;% unless version == 'ga' -%\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;% else -%\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;% end -%\u0026gt;.

Custom code can be used to add arbitrary logic to a resource while still generating most of the code; it allows for a balance between maintainability and supporting real-worlds APIs that deviate from what MMv1 can support. Custom code should only be added if the desired behavior can\u0026rsquo;t be achieved otherwise.\nMost custom code attributes are strings that contain a path to a template file relative to the mmv1 directory. For example:\ncustom_code: !ruby/object:Provider::Terraform::CustomCode # References mmv1/templates/terraform/custom_delete/resource_name_custom_delete.go.erb custom_delete: templates/terraform/custom_delete/resource_name_custom_delete.go.erb By convention, the template files are stored in a directory matching the type of custom code, and the name of the file includes the resource (and, if relevant, field) impacted by the custom code. Like handwritten resource and test code, custom code is written as ruby templates which render go code.\nWhen in doubt about the behavior of custom code, write the custom code, generate the providers, and inspect what changed in the providers using git diff.\nThe following sections describe types of custom code in more detail.\nAdd reusable variables and functions # custom_code: !ruby/object:Provider::Terraform::CustomCode constants: templates/terraform/constants/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.erb Use custom_code.constants to inject top-level code in a resource file.

Additional create tests can be used to ensure all fields on the resource are used in at least one test.\nMMv1 Using an editor of your choice, create a *.tf.erb file in mmv1/templates/terraform/examples/. The name of the file should include the service name, resource name, and a descriptor. For example, compute_subnetwork_basic.tf.erb. Write the Terraform configuration for your test. This should include all of the required dependencies. For example, google_compute_subnetwork has a dependency on google_compute_network: resource \u0026#34;google_compute_subnetwork\u0026#34; \u0026#34;primary\u0026#34; { name = \u0026#34;my-subnet\u0026#34; ip_cidr_range = \u0026#34;10.1.0.0/16\u0026#34; region = \u0026#34;us-central1\u0026#34; network = google_compute_network.network.name } resource \u0026#34;google_compute_network\u0026#34; \u0026#34;network\u0026#34; { name = \u0026#34;my-network\u0026#34; auto_create_subnetworks = false } If beta-only fields are being tested: Add provider = google-beta to every resource in the file. Modify the configuration to use templated values. Replace the id of the primary resource you are testing with \u0026lt;%= ctx[:primary_resource_id] %\u0026gt;. Replace fields that are identifiers, like id or name, with an appropriately named variable. For example, \u0026lt;%= ctx[:vars]['subnetwork_name'] %\u0026gt;. The resulting configuration for the above example would look like this: resource \u0026#34;google_compute_subnetwork\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026lt;%= ctx[:primary_resource_id] %\u0026gt;\u0026#34; { name = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;%= ctx[:vars][\u0026#39;subnetwork_name\u0026#39;] %\u0026gt;\u0026#34; ip_cidr_range = \u0026#34;10.1.0.0/16\u0026#34; region = \u0026#34;us-central1\u0026#34; network = google_compute_network.network.name } resource \u0026#34;google_compute_network\u0026#34; \u0026#34;network\u0026#34; { name = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;%= ctx[:vars][\u0026#39;network_name\u0026#39;] %\u0026gt;\u0026#34; auto_create_subnetworks = false } Modify the relevant RESOURCE_NAME.yaml file under magic-modules/mmv1/products to include an examples block with your test. The name must match the name of your *.tf.erb file. For example: examples: - !ruby/object:Provider::Terraform::Examples name: \u0026#34;compute_subnetwork_basic\u0026#34; primary_resource_id: \u0026#34;example\u0026#34; vars: subnetwork_name: \u0026#34;example-subnet\u0026#34; network_name: \u0026#34;example-network\u0026#34; Warning: Values in vars must include a - (or _). They trigger the addition of a tf-test prefix, which the sweeper uses to clean them up after tests run. If beta-only fields are being tested: Add min_version: beta to the examples block in RESOURCE_NAME.yaml. Handwritten This section assumes you\u0026rsquo;ve used the Add a resource guide to create your handwritten resource, and you have a working MMv1 config.\nNote: If not, you can create one now, or skip this guide and construct the test by hand. Writing tests by hand can sometimes be a better option if there is a similar test you can copy from.\nAdd the test in MMv1. Repeat for all the create tests you will need. Generate the beta provider. From the beta provider, copy and paste the generated *_generated_test.go file into the appropriate service folder inside magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services as a new file call *_test.go. Modify the tests as needed. Replace all occurrences of github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta/google-beta with github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/google Remove the comments at the top of the file. Remove the Example suffix from all function names. If beta-only fields are being tested, do the following: Change the file suffix to .go.erb Add \u0026lt;% autogen_exception -%\u0026gt; to the top of the file Wrap each beta-only test in a separate version guard: \u0026lt;% unless version == 'ga' -%\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;% else -%\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;% end -%\u0026gt; Add an update test # An update test is a test that creates the target resource and then makes updates to fields that are updatable. Updatable fields are fields that can be updated without recreating the entire resource; that is, they are not marked immutable in MMv1 or ForceNew in handwritten code.\nNote: All updatable fields must be covered by at least one update test. In most cases, only a single update test is needed to test all fields at once.\nMMv1 Generate the beta provider. From the beta provider, copy and paste the generated *_generated_test.go file into the appropriate service folder inside magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services as a new file call *_test.go. Using an editor of your choice, delete the *DestroyProducer function, and all but one test. The remaining test should be the \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; test, or if there is no \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; test, the \u0026ldquo;basic\u0026rdquo; test. This will be the starting point for your new update test. Modify the TestAcc* test function to support updates. Change the suffix of the test function to _update. Copy the 2 TestStep blocks and paste them immediately after, so that there are 4 total test steps. Change the suffix of the first Config value to _full (or _basic). Change the suffix of the second Config value to _update. The resulting test function would look similar to this: func TestAccPubsubTopic_update(t *testing.T) { ... acctest.VcrTest(t, resource.TestCase{ ... Steps: []resource.TestStep{ { Config: testAccPubsubTopic_full(...), }, { ... }, { Config: testAccPubsubTopic_update(...), }, { ... }, }, }) } Modify the testAcc* Terraform template function to support updates. Copy the template function and paste it immediately after so that there are 2 template functions. Change the suffix of the first template function to _full (or _basic). Change the suffix of the second template function to _update. The resulting template functions would look similar to this: func testAccPubsubTopic_full(...) string { ... } func testAccPubsubTopic_update(...) string { ... } Modify the test as needed. Replace all occurrences of github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta/google-beta with github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/google Modify the template function ending in _update so that updatable fields are changed or removed. This may require additions to the context map in the test function. Remove the comments at the top of the file. If beta-only fields are being tested, do the following: Change the file suffix to .go.erb Add \u0026lt;% autogen_exception -%\u0026gt; to the top of the file Wrap each beta-only test in a separate version guard: \u0026lt;% unless version == 'ga' -%\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;% else -%\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;% end -%\u0026gt; In each beta-only test, ensure that the TestCase sets ProtoV5ProviderFactories: acctest.ProtoV5ProviderBetaFactories(t) In each beta-only test, ensure that all Terraform resources in all configs have provider = google-beta set Handwritten Using an editor of your choice, open the existing *_test.go or *_test.go.erb file in the appropriate service folder inside magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services which contains your create tests. Copy the TestAcc* test function for the existing \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; test. If there is no \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; test, use the \u0026ldquo;basic\u0026rdquo; test.

Breaking changes are complicated; the exact process and implementation may vary drastically depending on the implementation of the impacted resource or field and the change being made.\nIn minor releases # If a breaking change fixes a bug that impacts all configurations that include a field or resource, it is generally allowed in a minor release. For example:\nRemoving update support from a field if that field is not actually updatable in the API. Marking a field required if omitting the field always causes an API error. The following types of changes can be made if the default behavior stays the same and new behavior can be enabled with a flag:\nMajor resource-level or field-level behavioural changes In the 5.0.0 major release # The general process for contributing a breaking change to the 5.0.0 major release is:\nMake the main branch forwards-compatible with the major release Add deprecations and warnings to the main branch of magic-modules Add upgrade guide entries to the main branch of magic-modules Make the breaking change on FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-5.0.0 These are covered in more detail in the following sections. The upgrade guide and the actual breaking change will be merged only after both are completed.\nMake the main branch forwards-compatible with the major release # What forwards-compatibility means will vary depending on the breaking change. For example:\nIf a required field is being removed, make the field optional on the main branch. If a field is being renamed, the new field must be added to the main branch Add deprecations and warnings to the main branch of magic-modules # Deprecations and warnings must be actionable at the time that they are added to the main branch, and they must be added prior to the 5.0.0 major release. Every deprecation or warning should be surfaced to users of the provider at runtime as well as in documentation.\nField deprecation (due to removal or rename) # MMv1 Set deprecation_message on the field. For example:\n- !ruby/object:Api::Type::String name: \u0026#39;apiFieldName\u0026#39; description: | MULTILINE_FIELD_DESCRIPTION deprecation_message: api_field_name is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use other_field_name instead. Replace the second sentence with an appropriate short description of the replacement path and/or the reason for deprecation.\nThe deprecation message will automatically show up in the resource documentation.\nHandwritten Set Deprecated on the field. For example:\n\u0026#34;api_field_name\u0026#34;: { Type: schema.String, Deprecated: \u0026#34;api_field_name is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use other_field_name instead.\u0026#34;, ... } Replace the second sentence with an appropriate short description of the replacement path and/or the reason for deprecation.\nUpdate the documentation for the field to include the deprecation notice. For example:\n* `api_field_name` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html), Deprecated) FIELD_DESCRIPTION. `api_field_name` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use `other_field_name` instead. Resource deprecation (due to removal or rename) # MMv1 Set deprecation_message on the resource. For example:\ndeprecation_message: \u0026gt;- `google_RESOURCE_NAME` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release of the provider. Use `google_OTHER_RESOURCE_NAME` instead. Replace RESOURCE_NAME with the name of the resource (excluding the google_ prefix). Replace the second sentence with an appropriate short description of the replacement path and/or the reason for deprecation.\nThe deprecation message will automatically show up in the resource documentation.\nHandwritten Set DeprecationMessage on the field. For example:\nreturn \u0026amp;schema.Resource{ ... DeprecationMessage: \u0026#34;`google_RESOURCE_NAME` is deprecated and will be removed in the next \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;major release of the provider. Use `google_OTHER_RESOURCE_NAME` instead.\u0026#34;, ... } Replace RESOURCE_NAME with the name of the resource (excluding the google_ prefix). Replace the second sentence with an appropriate short description of the replacement path and/or the reason for deprecation.\nAdd a warning to the resource documentation stating that the resource is deprecated. For example:\n~\u0026gt; **Warning:** `google_RESOURCE_NAME` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release of the provider. Use `google_OTHER_RESOURCE_NAME` instead. Other breaking changes # Other breaking changes should be called out in the docs for the impacted field or resource. It is also great to log warnings at runtime if possible.\nAdd upgrade guide entries to the main branch of magic-modules # Upgrade guide entries should be added to version_5_upgrade.html.markdown. Entries should focus on the changes that users need to make when upgrading to 5.0.0, rather than how to write configurations after upgrading.\nSee Terraform Google Provider 4.0.0 Upgrade Guide and other upgrade guides for examples.\nThe upgrade guide and the actual breaking change will be merged only after both are completed.\nMake the breaking change on FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-5.0.0 # When working on your breaking change, make sure that your base branch is FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-5.0.0. This means that you will follow the standard contribution process with the following changes:\nBefore you start, check out and sync your local magic-modules and provider repositories with the upstream major release branches. cd ~/magic-modules git checkout FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-5.0.0 git pull --ff-only origin FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-5.0.0 cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google git checkout FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-5.0.0 git pull --ff-only origin FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-5.0.0 cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta git checkout FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-5.0.0 git pull --ff-only origin FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-5.0.0 Make sure that any deprecation notices and warnings that you added in previous sections are present on the major release branch. Changes to the main branch will be merged into the major release branch every Monday. Make the breaking change. Remove any deprecation notices and warnings (including in documentation) not already removed by the breaking change. When you create your pull request, change the base branch to FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-5.0.0 To resolve merge conflicts with git rebase or git merge, use FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-5.0.0 instead of main. The upgrade guide and the actual breaking change will be merged only after both are completed.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? # Run tests "},{"id":22,"href":"/magic-modules/develop/breaking-changes/","title":"Types of breaking changes","section":"Develop","content":" Types of breaking changes # A \u0026ldquo;breaking change\u0026rdquo; is any change that requires an end user to modify a previously-valid configuration after a provider upgrade. In this context, a \u0026ldquo;valid configuration\u0026rdquo; is one that:\nIs considered syntactically correct by terraform validate Does not return an error during terraform apply Creates, updates, deletes, or does not modify resources Only manages resources that have not been altered with other tools, such as gcloud or Cloud Console. This document lists many types of breaking changes but may not be entirely comprehensive. Some types of changes that would normally be \u0026ldquo;breaking\u0026rdquo; may have specific mitigating circumstances that make them non-breaking.\nFor more information, see Make a breaking change.\nProvider-level breaking changes # Changing fundamental provider behavior such as: authentication environment variable usage restricting retry behavior Resource-level breaking changes # Removing or renaming a resource or datasource Changing resource ID format Terraform uses resource ID to read resource state from the API. Modification of the ID format will break the ability to parse the IDs from any deployments. Removing or altering resource import ID formats Automation written by end users may rely on specific import formats. Major changes to default resource behavior For example, changing the default implementation of resource deletion Field-level breaking changes # Removing or renaming a field Changing field output type Between primitive types, like changing a String to an Integer Between complex types like changing a List to a Set. Changing the field type between primitive and complex data types is not possible. For this scenario, field renames are preferred. Making an optional field required or adding a new required field Making a settable field read-only For MMv1 resources, adding output: true to an existing field. For handwritten resources, adding Computed: true to a field that does not have Optional: true set. Removing support for API-side defaults For MMv1 resources, removing default_from_api: true. For handwritten resources, altering a field schema with Computed: true + Optional: true to only have Optional: true. Adding or changing a default value Default values in Terraform are used to replace null values in configuration at plan/apply time and do not respect previously-configured values by the user. Even in major releases, these changes are often undesirable, as their impact is extremely broad.\nWhen a default is changed, every user that has not specified an explicit value in their configuration will see Terraform propose changing the value of the field including if the change will destroy and recreate the resource due to changing an immutable value. Default changes in the provider are comparable in impact to default changes in an API, and modifying examples and modules may achieve the intended effect with a smaller blast radius.\nModifying how field data is stored in state For example, changing the case of a value returned by the API in a flattener or decorder Removing diff suppression from a field. For MMv1 resources, removing diff_suppress_func from a field. For handwritten resources, removing DiffSuppressFunc from a field. Removing update support from a field. Making validation more strict # Increasing the minimum number of items in an array For MMv1 resources, increasing min_size on an Array field. For handwritten resources, increasing MinItems on an Array field. Decreasing the maximum number of items in an array For MMv1 resources, decreasing max_size on an Array field. For handwritten resources, decreasing MaxItems on an Array field. Adding validation to a field that previously had no validation For MMv1 resources, adding validation to a field. For handwritten resources, adding ValidateFunc to a field.
