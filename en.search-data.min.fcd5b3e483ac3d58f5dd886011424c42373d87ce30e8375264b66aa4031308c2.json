[{"id":0,"href":"/magic-modules/develop/test/test/","title":"Add resource tests","section":"Test","content":" Add resource tests # This page describes how to add tests to a new resource in the google or google-beta Terraform provider.\nThe providers have two basic types of tests:\nUnit tests: test specific functions thoroughly. Unit tests do not interact with GCP APIs. Acceptance tests (aka VCR tests, or create and update tests): test that resources interact as expected with the APIs. Acceptance tests interact with GCP APIs, but should only test the provider\u0026rsquo;s behavior in constructing the API requests and parsing the responses. Acceptance tests are also called \u0026ldquo;VCR tests\u0026rdquo; because they use go-vcr to record and play back HTTP requests. This allows tests to run more quickly on PRs because the resources don\u0026rsquo;t actually need to be created, updated, or destroyed by the live API.\nFor more information about testing, see the official Terraform documentation.\nBefore you begin # Determine whether your resources is using MMv1 generation or handwritten. If you are not adding tests to an in-progress PR, ensure that your magic-modules, terraform-provider-google, and terraform-provider-google-beta repositories are up to date. cd ~/magic-modules git checkout main \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git clean -f . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git checkout -- . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git pull cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google git checkout main \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git clean -f . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git checkout -- . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git pull cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta git checkout main \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git clean -f . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git checkout -- . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git pull Add a create test # A create test is a test that creates the target resource and immediately destroys it.\nNote: All resources should have a \u0026ldquo;basic\u0026rdquo; create test, which uses the smallest possible number of fields. Additional create tests can be used to ensure all fields on the resource are used in at least one test.\nMMv1 Using an editor of your choice, create a *.tf.tmpl file in mmv1/templates/terraform/examples/. The name of the file should include the service name, resource name, and a descriptor. For example, compute_subnetwork_basic.tf.tmpl. Write the Terraform configuration for your test. This should include all of the required dependencies. For example, google_compute_subnetwork has a dependency on google_compute_network: resource \u0026#34;google_compute_subnetwork\u0026#34; \u0026#34;primary\u0026#34; { name = \u0026#34;my-subnet\u0026#34; ip_cidr_range = \u0026#34;10.1.0.0/16\u0026#34; region = \u0026#34;us-central1\u0026#34; network = google_compute_network.network.name } resource \u0026#34;google_compute_network\u0026#34; \u0026#34;network\u0026#34; { name = \u0026#34;my-network\u0026#34; auto_create_subnetworks = false } If beta-only fields are being tested: Add provider = google-beta to every resource in the file. Modify the configuration to use templated values. Replace the id of the primary resource you are testing with {{$.PrimaryResourceId}}. Replace fields that are identifiers, like id or name, with an appropriately named variable. For example, {{index $.Vars \u0026quot;subnetwork_name\u0026quot;}}. The resulting configuration for the above example would look like this: resource \u0026#34;google_compute_subnetwork\u0026#34; \u0026#34;{{$.PrimaryResourceId}}\u0026#34; { name = \u0026#34;{{index $.Vars \u0026#34;subnetwork_name\u0026#34;}}\u0026#34; ip_cidr_range = \u0026#34;10.1.0.0/16\u0026#34; region = \u0026#34;us-central1\u0026#34; network = google_compute_network.network.name } resource \u0026#34;google_compute_network\u0026#34; \u0026#34;network\u0026#34; { name = \u0026#34;{{index $.Vars \u0026#34;network_name\u0026#34;}}\u0026#34; auto_create_subnetworks = false } Modify the relevant RESOURCE_NAME.yaml file under magic-modules/mmv1/products to include an examples block with your test. The name must match the name of your *.tf.tmpl file. For example: examples: - name: \u0026#34;compute_subnetwork_basic\u0026#34; primary_resource_id: \u0026#34;example\u0026#34; vars: subnetwork_name: \u0026#34;example-subnet\u0026#34; network_name: \u0026#34;example-network\u0026#34; Warning: Values in vars must include a - (or _). They trigger the addition of a tf-test prefix, which the sweeper uses to clean them up after tests run. If beta-only fields are being tested: Add min_version: 'beta' to the examples block in RESOURCE_NAME.yaml. Handwritten This section assumes you\u0026rsquo;ve used the Add a resource guide to create your handwritten resource, and you have a working MMv1 config.\nNote: If not, you can create one now, or skip this guide and construct the test by hand. Writing tests by hand can sometimes be a better option if there is a similar test you can copy from.\nAdd the test in MMv1. Repeat for all the create tests you will need. Generate the beta provider. From the beta provider, copy and paste the generated *_generated_test.go file into the appropriate service folder inside magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services as a new file call *_test.go. Modify the tests as needed. Replace all occurrences of github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta/google-beta with github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/google Remove the comments at the top of the file. Remove the Example suffix from all function names. If beta-only fields are being tested, do the following: Change the file suffix to .go.tmpl Wrap each beta-only test in a separate version guard: {{- if ne $.TargetVersionName \u0026quot;ga\u0026quot; -}}...{{- else }}...{{- end }} Add an update test # An update test is a test that creates the target resource and then makes updates to fields that are updatable. Updatable fields are fields that can be updated without recreating the entire resource; that is, they are not marked immutable in MMv1 or ForceNew in handwritten code.\nNote: All updatable fields must be covered by at least one update test. In most cases, only a single update test is needed to test all fields at once.\nMMv1 Generate the beta provider. From the beta provider, copy and paste the generated *_generated_test.go file into the appropriate service folder inside magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services as a new file call *_test.go. Using an editor of your choice, delete the *DestroyProducer function, and all but one test. The remaining test should be the \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; test, or if there is no \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; test, the \u0026ldquo;basic\u0026rdquo; test. This will be the starting point for your new update test. Modify the TestAcc* test function to support updates. Change the suffix of the test function to _update. Copy the 2 TestStep blocks and paste them immediately after, so that there are 4 total test steps. Change the suffix of the first Config value to _full (or _basic). Change the suffix of the second Config value to _update. The resulting test function would look similar to this: func TestAccPubsubTopic_update(t *testing.T) { ... acctest.VcrTest(t, resource.TestCase{ ... Steps: []resource.TestStep{ { Config: testAccPubsubTopic_full(...), }, { ... }, { Config: testAccPubsubTopic_update(...), }, { ... }, }, }) } Modify the testAcc* Terraform template function to support updates. Copy the template function and paste it immediately after so that there are 2 template functions. Change the suffix of the first template function to _full (or _basic). Change the suffix of the second template function to _update. The resulting template functions would look similar to this: func testAccPubsubTopic_full(...) string { ... } func testAccPubsubTopic_update(...) string { ... } Modify the test as needed. Replace all occurrences of github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta/google-beta with github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/google Modify the template function ending in _update so that updatable fields are changed or removed. This may require additions to the context map in the test function. Remove the comments at the top of the file. If beta-only fields are being tested, do the following: Change the file suffix to .go.tmpl Wrap each beta-only test in a separate version guard: {{- if ne $.TargetVersionName \u0026quot;ga\u0026quot; -}}...{{- else }}...{{- end }} In each beta-only test, ensure that the TestCase sets ProtoV5ProviderFactories: acctest.ProtoV5ProviderBetaFactories(t) In each beta-only test, ensure that all Terraform resources in all configs have provider = google-beta set Handwritten Using an editor of your choice, open the existing *_test.go or *_test.go.tmpl file in the appropriate service folder inside magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services which contains your create tests. Copy the TestAcc* test function for the existing \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; test. If there is no \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; test, use the \u0026ldquo;basic\u0026rdquo; test.

Copy the 2 TestStep blocks and paste them immediately after, so that there are 4 total test steps. Change the suffix of the second Config value to _update. Add ConfigPlanChecks to the update step of the test to ensure the resource is updated in-place. The resulting test function would look similar to this: func TestAccPubsubTopic_update(t *testing.T) { ... acctest.VcrTest(t, resource.TestCase{ ... Steps: []resource.TestStep{ { Config: testAccPubsubTopic_full(...), }, { ... }, { Config: testAccPubsubTopic_update(...), ConfigPlanChecks: resource.ConfigPlanChecks{ PreApply: []plancheck.PlanCheck{ plancheck.ExpectResourceAction(\u0026#34;google_pubsub_topic.foo\u0026#34;, plancheck.ResourceActionUpdate), }, }, }, { ... }, }, }) } Add a Terraform template function to support updates.

For example: If you are adding multiple resources to the provider, only put one resource in each PR - even if the product requires all resources to be present before it can be meaningfully used. If you are adding a few fields and also fixing a bug, create one PR for adding the new fields and a separate PR for the bugs. Follow the instructions at Creating a pull request to create a pull request to merge your branch into GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules. Make sure the PR body includes the text Fixes GITHUB_ISSUE_LINK. once per issue resolved by your PR. Replace GITHUB_ISSUE_LINK with a link to a GitHub issue from the provider issue tracker. Write release notes Code review # A reviewer will automatically be assigned to your PR. Creating a new pull request or pushing a new commit automatically triggers our CI pipelines and workflows. After CI starts, downstream diff generation takes about 10 minutes; VCR tests can take up to 2 hours. If you are a community contributor, some tests will only run after approval from a reviewer. While convenient, relying on CI to test iterative changes to PRs often adds extreme latency to reviews if there are errors in test configurations or at runtime. We strongly recommend you test your changes locally before pushing even after the initial change. VCR tests will first attempt to play back recorded HTTP requests (REPLAYING mode). If any tests fail, they will run in RECORDING mode to generate a new cassette; then, the same tests will run again in REPLAYING mode to detect any nondeterministic behavior in the test (which can cause flaky tests.) If your assigned reviewer does not respond to changes on a pull request within two US business days, ping them on the pull request. TIP: Speeding up review:\nTest your changes locally before pushing to iterate faster. You can push them and test in parallel as well. New CI runs will preempt old ones where possible. Resolve failed status checks quickly Directly ask your reviewer for help if you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to proceed. If there are failed checks they may only check in if there\u0026rsquo;s no progress after a couple days. Self-review your PR or ask someone else familiar with Terraform to review Troubleshoot status check failures # Provider unit tests or VCR tests # VCR test failures that do not immediately seem related to your PR are most likely safe to ignore unless your reviewer says otherwise.\nReview the \u0026ldquo;diff generation\u0026rdquo; report to make sure the generated code looks as expected. Check out the generated code for your PR to run tests and iterate locally. For handwritten code or custom code, you can iterate directly in the provider and then copy the changes to your magic-modules branch once you have resolved the issue. terraform-provider-google cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google git checkout -- . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git clean -f google/ google-beta/ website/ git remote add modular-magician https://github.com/modular-magician/terraform-provider-google.git git fetch modular-magician git checkout modular-magician/auto-pr-PR_NUMBER make test make lint make testacc TEST=./google/services/container TESTARGS=\u0026#39;-run=TestAccContainerNodePool\u0026#39; Replace PR_NUMBER with your PR\u0026rsquo;s ID.\nterraform-provider-google-beta cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta git checkout -- . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git clean -f google/ google-beta/ website/ git remote add modular-magician https://github.com/modular-magician/terraform-provider-google-beta.git git fetch modular-magician git checkout modular-magician/auto-pr-PR_NUMBER make test make lint make testacc TEST=./google/services/container TESTARGS=\u0026#39;-run=TestAccContainerNodePool\u0026#39; Replace PR_NUMBER with your PR\u0026rsquo;s ID.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/magic-modules/get-started/generate-providers/","title":"Generate the providers","section":"Get started","content":" Generate google and google-beta providers # This quickstart guides you through setting up your development environment, making a change to magic-modules, generating provider changes to the google and google-beta Terraform providers, and running tests related to the change.\nBefore you begin # Install the gcloud CLI.

This document lists many types of breaking changes but may not be entirely comprehensive. Some types of changes that would normally be \u0026ldquo;breaking\u0026rdquo; may have specific mitigating circumstances that make them non-breaking.\nFor more information, see Make a breaking change.\nProvider-level breaking changes # Changing fundamental provider behavior such as: authentication environment variable usage restricting retry behavior Resource-level breaking changes # Removing or renaming a resource or datasource Changing resource ID format Terraform uses resource ID to read resource state from the API. Modification of the ID format will break the ability to parse the IDs from any deployments. Removing or altering resource import ID formats Automation written by end users may rely on specific import formats. Changes to default resource behavior Changing resource deletion behavior In limited cases changes may be permissible if the prior behavior could never succeed. Changing resource deletion to skip deleting the resource by default if delete was previously called Changing resource deletion to specify a force flag Adding a new field with a default different from the API default If an API default is expected to change- a breaking change for the API- use default_from_api which will avoid sending a value and safely take the server default in Terraform Field-level breaking changes # Removing or renaming a field Changing field output type Between primitive types, like changing a String to an Integer Between complex types like changing a List to a Set. Changing the field type between primitive and complex data types is not possible. For this scenario, field renames are preferred. Making an optional field required or adding a new required field Making a settable field read-only For MMv1 resources, adding output: true to an existing field. For handwritten resources, adding Computed: true to a field that does not have Optional: true set. Even if there is no valid scenario where a field can be set, changing it to read-only may be a breaking change for modules that depend on the provider. Removing support for API-side defaults For MMv1 resources, removing default_from_api: true. For handwritten resources, altering a field schema with Computed: true + Optional: true to only have Optional: true. Adding or changing a default value Default values in Terraform are used to replace null values in configuration at plan/apply time and do not respect previously-configured values by the user. Even in major releases, these changes are often undesirable, as their impact is extremely broad.\nWhen a default is changed, every user that has not specified an explicit value in their configuration will see Terraform propose changing the value of the field including if the change will destroy and recreate the resource due to changing an immutable value. Default changes in the provider are comparable in impact to default changes in an API, and modifying examples and modules may achieve the intended effect with a smaller blast radius.\nModifying how field data is stored in state For example, changing the case of a value returned by the API in a flattener or decorder Removing diff suppression from a field. For MMv1 resources, removing diff_suppress_func from a field. For handwritten resources, removing DiffSuppressFunc from a field. Removing update support from a field. Making validation more strict # Increasing the minimum number of items in an array For MMv1 resources, increasing min_size on an Array field. For handwritten resources, increasing MinItems on an Array field. Decreasing the maximum number of items in an array For MMv1 resources, decreasing max_size on an Array field. For handwritten resources, decreasing MaxItems on an Array field. Adding validation to a field that previously had no validation For MMv1 resources, adding validation to a field. For handwritten resources, adding ValidateFunc to a field.

Magic Modules uses that mapping (and additional handwritten code where necessary) to generate \u0026ldquo;downstream\u0026rdquo; repositories - in particular, the Terraform providers for Google Cloud: google (or TPG) and google-beta (or TPGB).\nGeneration of the downstream repositories happens for every new commit in a PR (to a temporary branch owned by the modular-magician robot user) and on every merge into the main branch (to the main branch of downstreams). Generation for PR commits allows contributors to manually examine the changes, as well as allowing automatic running of unit tests, acceptance tests, and automated checks such as breaking change detection.\nResource types # There are three types of resources supported by Magic Modules: MMv1, Handwritten, and DCL/tpgtools. These are described in more detail in the following sections.\nMMv1 # MMv1 consists of a set of \u0026ldquo;products\u0026rdquo;; each product contains one or more \u0026ldquo;resources\u0026rdquo;.\nEach product has a folder in magic-modules/mmv1/products. The name of the folder is the \u0026ldquo;product name\u0026rdquo;, which usually corresponds to the API subdomain covered by the product (such as compute.googleapis.com). Each product folder contains a product configuration file (product.yaml) and one or more resource configuration files (ResourceName.yaml). The actual name of a ResourceName.yaml file usually matches the name of a GCP API resource in the product\u0026rsquo;s subdomain.\nMMv1 resource configurations may reference handwritten code stored in magic-modules/mmv1/templates/terraform, which will be injected into the generated resource file. Many MMv1 resources also have one or more handwritten tests, which are stored in the appropriate service folder inside magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services\nIn the providers, MMv1-based resources are stored in PROVIDER/services/PRODUCT/resource_PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go, where PROVIDER is google or google-beta, PRODUCT is the product name, and RESOURCE is the GCP API resource\u0026rsquo;s name converted to snake case ↗.\nMMv1-based files start with the following header:\n*** AUTO GENERATED CODE *** Type: MMv1 *** Handwritten # Handwritten resources and datasources are technically part of MMv1; however, they are not generated from YAML configurations. Instead, they are written as Go code with minimal go template \u0026ldquo;version guards\u0026rdquo; to exclude beta-only features from the google provider.\nHandwritten resources and datasources can be grouped by \u0026ldquo;service\u0026rdquo;, which generally corresponds to the API subdomain the resource or datasource interacts with.\nIn addition to the core implementation, handwritten resources and datasources will also have documentation, tests, and sweepers (which clean up stray resources left behind by tests). Each type of code is stored in the following locations:\nResource \u0026amp; datasource implementation: In the appropriate service folder inside magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services Resource documentation: magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/website/docs/r Datasource documentation: magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/website/docs/d Tests: In the appropriate service folder inside magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/services Sweepers: magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/utils In the providers, handwritten resources and datasources are stored in PROVIDER/services/SERVICE/FILENAME.go, where PROVIDER is google or google-beta, SERVICE is the service name, and FILENAME is the name of the handwritten file in magic-modules. Handwritten files do not have an AUTO GENERATED CODE header.\nDCL aka tpgtools (maintenance mode) # DCL / tpgtools is similar to MMv1; however, it is in maintenance mode, which means that new resources using the DCL are not being added.\nDCL-based files start with the following header:\n*** AUTO GENERATED CODE *** Type: DCL *** "},{"id":9,"href":"/magic-modules/develop/breaking-changes/make-a-breaking-change/","title":"Make a breaking change","section":"Breaking changes","content":" Make a breaking change # A \u0026ldquo;breaking change\u0026rdquo; is any change that requires an end user to modify any previously-valid configuration after a provider upgrade. For more information, see Types of breaking changes.\nThe google and google-beta providers are both considered \u0026ldquo;stable surfaces\u0026rdquo; for the purpose of releases, which means that neither provider allows breaking changes except during major releases, which are typically yearly.\nTerraform users rely on the stability of Terraform providers (including the Google Cloud provider and other major providers.) Even as part of a major release, breaking changes that are overly broad and/or have little benefit to users can cause deeply negative reactions and significantly delay customers upgrading to the new major version.\nBreaking changes may cause significant churn for users by forcing them to update their configurations. It also causes churn in tooling built on top of the providers, such as:\nTerraform modules that use google or google-beta resources Policy tools like gcloud terraform vet There may also be churn in customer policies Config Connector Pulumi GCP Classic This page covers the general process to make a breaking change. It does not include exact, comprehensive details on how to make every potential breaking change. Breaking changes are complicated; the exact process and implementation may vary drastically depending on the implementation of the impacted resource or field and the change being made.\nIn minor releases # If a breaking change fixes a bug that impacts all configurations that include a field or resource, it is generally allowed in a minor release. For example:\nRemoving update support from a field if that field is not actually updatable in the API. Marking a field required if omitting the field always causes an API error. The following types of changes can be made if the default behavior stays the same and new behavior can be enabled with a flag:\nMajor resource-level or field-level behavioural changes In the 6.0.0 major release # The general process for contributing a breaking change to the 6.0.0 major release is:\nMake the main branch forwards-compatible with the major release Add deprecations and warnings to the main branch of magic-modules Add upgrade guide entries to the FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 branch of magic-modules Make the breaking change on FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 These are covered in more detail in the following sections. The upgrade guide and the actual breaking change will be merged only after both are completed.\nMake the main branch forwards-compatible with the major release # What forwards-compatibility means will vary depending on the breaking change. For example:\nIf a required field is being removed, make the field optional on the main branch. If a field is being renamed, the new field must be added to the main branch Add deprecations and warnings to the main branch of magic-modules # Deprecations and warnings must be actionable at the time that they are added to the main branch, and they must be added prior to the 6.0.0 major release. Every deprecation or warning should be surfaced to users of the provider at runtime as well as in documentation.\nField deprecation (due to removal or rename) # MMv1 Set deprecation_message on the field. For example:\n- name: \u0026#39;apiFieldName\u0026#39; type: String description: | MULTILINE_FIELD_DESCRIPTION deprecation_message: \u0026#39;`api_field_name` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use `other_field_name` instead.\u0026#39; Replace the second sentence with an appropriate short description of the replacement path and/or the reason for deprecation.\nThe deprecation message will automatically show up in the resource documentation.\nHandwritten Set Deprecated on the field. For example:\n\u0026#34;api_field_name\u0026#34;: { Type: schema.String, Deprecated: \u0026#34;`api_field_name` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use `other_field_name` instead.\u0026#34;, ... } Replace the second sentence with an appropriate short description of the replacement path and/or the reason for deprecation.\nUpdate the documentation for the field to include the deprecation notice. For example:\n* `api_field_name` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html), Deprecated) FIELD_DESCRIPTION. `api_field_name` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use `other_field_name` instead. Resource deprecation (due to removal or rename) # MMv1 Set deprecation_message on the resource. For example:\ndeprecation_message: \u0026gt;- `google_RESOURCE_NAME` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use `google_OTHER_RESOURCE_NAME` instead. Replace RESOURCE_NAME with the name of the resource (excluding the google_ prefix). Replace the second sentence with an appropriate short description of the replacement path and/or the reason for deprecation.\nThe deprecation message will automatically show up in the resource documentation.\nHandwritten Set DeprecationMessage on the field. For example:\nreturn \u0026amp;schema.Resource{ ... DeprecationMessage: \u0026#34;`google_RESOURCE_NAME` is deprecated and will be removed in a future \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;major release. Use `google_OTHER_RESOURCE_NAME` instead.\u0026#34;, ... } Replace RESOURCE_NAME with the name of the resource (excluding the google_ prefix). Replace the second sentence with an appropriate short description of the replacement path and/or the reason for deprecation.\nAdd a warning to the resource documentation stating that the resource is deprecated. For example:\n~\u0026gt; **Warning:** `google_RESOURCE_NAME` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use `google_OTHER_RESOURCE_NAME` instead. Other breaking changes # Other breaking changes should be called out in the docs for the impacted field or resource. It is also great to log warnings at runtime if possible.\nMake the change on FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 # When working on your breaking change, make sure that your base branch is FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0. This means that you will follow the standard contribution process with the following changes:\nBefore you start, check out and sync your local magic-modules and provider repositories with the upstream major release branches. cd ~/magic-modules git checkout FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 git pull --ff-only origin FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google git checkout FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 git pull --ff-only origin FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta git checkout FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 git pull --ff-only origin FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 Make sure that any deprecation notices and warnings that you added in previous sections are present on the major release branch. Changes to the main branch will be merged into the major release branch every Monday. Make the breaking change. Add the upgrade guide entries to version_6_upgrade.html.markdown. Entries should focus on the changes that users need to make when upgrading to 6.0.0, rather than how to write configurations after upgrading. See Terraform provider for Google Cloud 5.0.0 Upgrade Guide and other upgrade guides for examples. Remove any deprecation notices and warnings (including in documentation) not already removed by the breaking change. When you create your pull request, change the base branch to FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 To resolve merge conflicts with git rebase or git merge, use FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 instead of main.

For example, \u0026ldquo;added\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;fixed\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;resolved\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. You can use future tense to describe future changes, such as saying that a deprecated field will be removed in a future version. Don\u0026rsquo;t use present or future tense to describe changes that are included in the pull request. Write user-focused release notes. For example, reference specific impacted terraform resource and field names, and discuss changes in behavior users will experience. Avoid API field/resource/feature names. Avoid implementation details. Avoid language that requires understanding of provider internals. Surround resource or field names with backticks. Don\u0026rsquo;t use resource or field names without punctuation or with other punctuation like quotation marks. Use impersonal third person. Don\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo;, etc. If the pull request impacts any specific, begin your release note with that product name followed by a colon. Use lower case for the first letter after the colon. For example, cloudrun: added... For MMv1 resources, use the folder name that contains the yaml files as the product name; for handwritten or tpgtools resources, use the API subdomain; for broad cross-product changes, use provider. Don\u0026rsquo;t begin your release note with the full resource name. Don\u0026rsquo;t add backticks around the product name. Don\u0026rsquo;t capitalize the first letter after the colon. Examples # ```release-note:bug cloudrun: fixed perma-diff in `google_cloud_run_service` ``` ```release-note:deprecation container: deprecated `region` and `zone` on `google_container_unicorn`. Use `location` instead. ``` "},{"id":12,"href":"/magic-modules/best-practices/","title":"Best practices","section":"Overview","content":" Best practices # The following is a list of best practices that contributions are expected to follow in order to ensure a consistent UX for the Terraform provider for Google Cloud internally and also compared to other Terraform providers.\nForceNew # ForceNew in a Terraform resource schema attribute that indicates that a field is immutable – that is, that a change to the field requires the resource to be destroyed and recreated.\nThis is necessary and required for cases where a field can\u0026rsquo;t be updated in-place, so that Terraform\u0026rsquo;s core workflow of aligning real infrastructure with configuration can be achieved. If a field or resource can never be updated in-place and is not marked with ForceNew, that is considered a bug in the provider.\nSome fields or resources may be possible to update in place, but only under specific conditions. In these cases, you can treat the field as updatable - that is, do not mark it as ForceNew; instead, implement standard update functionality. Then, call diff.ForceNew inside a CustomizeDiff if the appropriate conditions to allow update in place are not met. Any CustomizeDiff function like this must be thoroughly unit tested. Making a field conditionally updatable like this is considered a good and useful enhancement in cases where recreation is costly and conditional updates do not introduce undue complexity.\nIn complex cases, it is better to mark the field ForceNew to ensure that users can apply their configurations successfully.\nMitigating data loss risk via deletion_protection # Some resources, such as databases, have a significant risk of unrecoverable data loss if the resource is accidentally deleted due to a change to a ForceNew field. For these resources, the best practice is to add a deletion_protection field that defaults to true, which prevents the resource from being deleted if enabled. Although it is a small breaking change, for users, the benefits of deletion_protection defaulting to true outweigh the cost.\nAPIs also sometimes add deletion_protection fields, which will generally default to false for backwards-compatibility reasons. Any deletion_protection API field added to an existing Terraform resource must match the API default initially. The default may be set to true in the next major release. For new Terraform resources, any deletion_protection field should default to true in Terraform regardless of the API default. When creating the corresponding Terraform field, the name should match the API field name (i.e. it need not literally be named deletion_protection if the API uses something different) and should be the same field type (example: if the API field is an enum, so should the Terraform field).\nA resource can have up to two deletion_protection fields (with different names): one that represents a field in the API, and one that is only in Terraform. This could happen because the API added its field after deletion_protection already existed in Terraform; it could also happen because a separate field was added in Terraform to make sure that deletion_protection is enabled by default. In either case, they should be reconciled into a single field (that defaults to enabled and whose name matches the API field) in the next major release.\nResources that do not have a significant risk of unrecoverable data loss or similar critical concern will not be given deletion_protection fields.\nSee Client-side fields for information about adding deletion_protection fields.\nNote: The previous best practice was a field called force_delete that defaulted to false. This is still present on some resources for backwards-compatibility reasons, but deletion_protection is preferred going forward. Deletion policy # Some resources need to let users control the actions taken add deletion time. For these resources, the best practice is to add a deletion_policy enum field that defaults to an empty string and allows special values that control the deletion behavior.\nOne common example is ABANDON, which is useful if the resource is safe to delete from Terraform but could cause problems if deleted from the API - for example, google_bigtable_gc_policy deletion can fail in replicated instances. ABANDON indicates that attempts to delete the resource should remove it from state without actually deleting it.\nSee Client-side fields for information about adding deletion_policy fields.\nAdd labels and annotations support # The new labels model and the new annotations model are introduced in Terraform provider for Google Cloud 5.0.0.\nThere are now three label-related fields with the new labels model:\nThe labels field is now non-authoritative and only manages the label keys defined in your configuration for the resource. The terraform_labels cannot be specified directly by the user. It merges the labels defined in the resource\u0026rsquo;s configuration and the default labels configured in the provider block. If the same label key exists on both the resource level and provider level, the value on the resource will override the provider-level default. The output-only effective_labels will list all the labels present on the resource in GCP, including the labels configured through Terraform, the system, and other clients. There are now two annotation-related fields with the new annotations model:\nThe annotations field is now non-authoritative and only manages the annotation keys defined in your configuration for the resource. The output-only effective_annotations will list all the annotations present on the resource in GCP, including the annotations configured through Terraform, the system, and other clients. This document describes how to add labels and annotations field to resources to support the new models.\nLabels support # When adding a new labels field, please make the changes below to support the new labels model.

For example, a map that references a specific type of resource would generally use the singular resource kind as the key name (such as \u0026ldquo;topic\u0026rdquo; for PubSub Topic) and a descriptor of the expected format depending on the context (such as resourceId vs full resource name).\nModify the field configuration according to the API documentation and behavior. Note: The templates in this section only include the most commonly-used fields. For a comprehensive reference, see MMv1 field reference. For information about modifying the values sent and received for a field, see Modify the API request or response.\nHandwritten Add the field to the handwritten resource\u0026rsquo;s schema. The new field(s) should mirror the API\u0026rsquo;s structure to ease predictability and maintenance. However, if there is an existing related / similar field in the resource that uses a different convention, follow that convention instead. Enum fields in the API should be represented as TypeString in Terraform for forwards-compatibility. Link to the API documentation of allowed values in the field description. Terraform field names should always use snake case ↗. See Schema Types ↗ and Schema Behaviors ↗ for more information about field schemas. Add handling for the new field in the resource\u0026rsquo;s Create method and Update methods. \u0026ldquo;Expanders\u0026rdquo; convert Terraform resource data to API request data. For top level fields, add an expander. If the field is set or has changed, call the expander and add the resulting value to the API request. For other fields, add logic to the parent field\u0026rsquo;s expander to add the field to the API request. Use a nested expander for complex logic. Add handling for the new field in the resource\u0026rsquo;s Read method. \u0026ldquo;Flatteners\u0026rdquo; convert API response data to Terraform resource data. For top level fields, add a flattener. Call d.Set() on the flattened API response value to store it in Terraform state. For other fields, add logic to the parent field\u0026rsquo;s flattener to convert the value from the API response to the Terraform state value. Use a nested flattener for complex logic. If any of the added Go code (including any imports) is beta-only, change the file suffix to .go.tmpl and wrap the beta-only code in a version guard: {{- if ne $.TargetVersionName \u0026quot;ga\u0026quot; -}}...{{- else }}...{{- end }}. Add a new guard rather than adding the field to an existing guard; it is easier to read. Add IAM support # This section covers how to add IAM resources in Terraform if they are supported by a particular API resource (indicated by setIamPolicy and getIamPolicy methods in the API documentation for the resource).\nMMv1 IAM support for MMv1-generated resources is configured within the ResourceName.yaml file, and will create the google_product_resource_iam_policy, google_product_resource_iam_binding, google_product_resource_iam_member resource, website, and test files for that resource target when an iam_policy block is present.\nAdd the following top-level block to ResourceName.yaml directly above parameters. iam_policy: # Name of the field on the terraform IAM resources which references # the parent resource.

For a full list of available properties, see type.go ↗.\nShared properties # min_version: beta # Marks the field (and any subfields) as beta-only. Ensure a beta version block is present in provider.yaml. Do not use if an ancestor field (or the overall resource) is already marked as beta-only.\nimmutable # If true, the field (and any subfields) are considered immutable - that is, only settable on create. If unset or false, the field is still considered immutable if any ancestor field (or the overall resource) is immutable, unless update_url is set.\nExample:\nimmutable: true update_url # If set, changes to the field\u0026rsquo;s value trigger a separate call to a specific API method for updating the field\u0026rsquo;s value. The field is not considered immutable even if an ancestor field (or the overall resource) is immutable. Terraform field names enclosed in double curly braces are replaced with the field values from the resource at runtime.\nExample:\nupdate_url: \u0026#39;projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/resourcenames/{{name}}/setFieldName\u0026#39; update_verb # If update_url is also set, overrides the verb used to update this specific field. Allowed values: \u0026lsquo;POST\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;PUT\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;PATCH\u0026rsquo;. Default: Resource\u0026rsquo;s update_verb (which defaults to \u0026lsquo;PUT\u0026rsquo; if unset).\nExample:\nupdate_verb: \u0026#39;POST\u0026#39; required # If true, the field is required. If unset or false, the field is optional.\nExample:\nrequired: true output # If true, the field is output-only - that is, it cannot be configured by the user. If unset or false, the field is configurable.\nExample:\noutput: true sensitive # If true, the field is considered \u0026ldquo;sensitive\u0026rdquo;, which means that its value will be obscured in Terraform output such as plans. If false, the value will not be obscured. Either way, the value will still be stored in plaintext in Terraform state. See Handling Sensitive Values in State for more information.\nSensitive fields are often not returned by the API (because they are sensitive). In this case, the field will also need to use ignore_read or a custom_flatten function.\nExample:\nsensitive: true ignore_read # If true, the provider sets the field\u0026rsquo;s value in the resource state based only on the user\u0026rsquo;s configuration. If false or unset, the provider sets the field\u0026rsquo;s value in the resource state based on the API response. Only use this attribute if the field cannot be read from GCP due to either API or provider constraints.\nNested fields currently do not support ignore_read but can replicate the behavior by implementing a custom_flatten that always ignores the value returned by the API. Example. Any fields using a custom flatten also need to be added to ignore_read_extra for any examples where the field is set.\nExample: YAML\nignore_read: true Example: Custom flatten\nfunc flatten{{$.GetPrefix}}{{$.TitlelizeProperty}}(v interface{}, d *schema.ResourceData, config *transport_tpg.Config) interface{} { return d.Get(\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;) } default_value # Sets a client-side default value for the field. This should be used if the API has a default value that applies in all cases and is stable. Removing or changing a default value is a breaking change. If unset, the field defaults to an \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; value (such as zero, false, or an empty string).\nExample:\ndefault_value: DEFAULT_VALUE default_from_api # If true, and the field is either not set or set to an \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; value (such as zero, false, or empty strings), the provider accepts any value returned from the API as the value for the field. If false, and the field is either not set or set to an \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; value, the provider treats the field\u0026rsquo;s default_value as the value for the field and shows a diff if the API returns any other value for the field. This attribute is useful for complex or frequently-changed API-side defaults, but provides less useful information at plan time than default_value and causes the provider to ignore user configurations that explicitly set the field to an \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; value. default_from_api and send_empty_value cannot both be true on the same field.\nExample:\ndefault_from_api: true send_empty_value # If true, the provider sends \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; values (such as zero, false, or empty strings) to the API if set explicitly in the user\u0026rsquo;s configuration. If false, \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; values cause the field to be omitted entirely from the API request. This attribute is useful for fields where the API would behave differently for an \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; value vs no value for a particular field - for example, boolean fields that have an API-side default of true. send_empty_value and default_from_api cannot both be true on the same field.\nExample:\nsend_empty_value: true conflicts # Specifies a list of fields (excluding the current field) that cannot be specified at the same time as the current field. Must be set separately on all listed fields. Not supported within lists of nested objects.\nExample:\n- name: \u0026#39;fieldOne\u0026#39; type: String conflicts: - field_two - nested_object.0.nested_field exactly_one_of # Specifies a list of fields (including the current field) of which exactly one must be set.

In many cases, a custom flattener is preferred because it will allow the user to see a clearer diff when the field actually is being changed. See Fix a permadiff for more information and best practices.\nThe function specified can be a provider-specific function (for example, tgpresource.CaseDiffSuppress) or a function defined in resource-specific custom code.\nExample:\n- name: \u0026#39;fieldOne\u0026#39; type: String diff_suppress_func: \u0026#39;tpgresource.CaseDiffSuppress\u0026#39; validation # Controls the value set for the field\u0026rsquo;s ValidateFunc.\nFor Enum fields, this will override the default validation (that the provided value is one of the enum values). If you need additional validation on top of an enum, ensure that the supplied validation func also verifies the enum values are correct.\nThis property has two mutually exclusive child properties:\nfunction: The name of a validation function to use for validation. The function can be a Terraform-provided function (for example, validation.IntAtLeast(0)), a provider-specific function (for example, verify.ValidateBase64String), or a function defined in resource-specific custom code. regex: A regex string to check values against. This can only be used on simple String fields. It is equivalent to function: verify.ValidateRegexp(REGEX_STRING). validation is not supported for Array fields (including sets); however, individual elements in the array can be validated using item_validation.\nExample: Provider-specific function\n- name: \u0026#39;fieldOne\u0026#39; type: String validation: function: \u0026#39;verify.ValidateBase64String\u0026#39; Example: Regex\n- name: \u0026#39;fieldOne\u0026#39; type: String validation: regex: \u0026#39;^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$\u0026#39; api_name # Specifies a name to use for communication with the API that is different than the name of the field in Terraform.

For example:\nfunc expand{{$.GetPrefix}}{{$.TitlelizeProperty}}(v interface{}, d tpgresource.TerraformResourceData, config *transport_tpg.Config) (interface{}, error) { if v == nil { return nil, nil } return base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString([]byte(v.(string))), nil } The parameters the function receives are:\nv: The value for the field d: Terraform resource data. Use d.Get(\u0026quot;field_name\u0026quot;) to get a field\u0026rsquo;s current value. config: Config object. Can be used to make API calls. The function returns a final value that will be sent to the API.\nModify the API request data for an entire resource # custom_code: encoder: templates/terraform/encoder/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl update_encoder: templates/terraform/update_encoder/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl Use custom_code.encoder to inject code that modifies the data that will be sent in the API request. This is useful if the API expects the data to be in a significantly different structure than Terraform does - for example, if the API expects the entire object to be nested under a key, or a particular field must never be sent to the API. The encoder will run after any custom_expand code.\nThe encoder code will be wrapped in a function like:\nfunc resourceProductResourceEncoder(d *schema.ResourceData, meta interface{}, obj map[string]interface{}) (map[string]interface{}, error) { // Your code will be injected here. } The parameters the function receives are:\nd: Terraform resource data. Use d.Get(\u0026quot;field_name\u0026quot;) to get a field\u0026rsquo;s current value. meta: Can be cast to a Config object (which can make API calls) using meta.(*transport_tpg.Config) obj: The data that will be sent to the API. The function returns data that will be sent to the API and an optional error.\nIf the Create and Update methods for the resource need different logic, set custom_code.update_encoder to override the logic for update only. It is otherwise the same as custom_code.encoder.\nModify the API response data for an entire resource # custom_code: decoder: templates/terraform/decoder/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl Use custom_code.decoder to inject code that modifies the data recieved from an API response. This is useful if the API returns data in a significantly different structure than what Terraform expects - for example, if the API returns the entire object nested under a key, or uses a different name for a field in the response than in the request. The decoder will run before any custom_flatten code.\nThe decoder code will be wrapped in a function like:\nfunc resourceProductResourceDecoder(d *schema.ResourceData, meta interface{}, res map[string]interface{}) (map[string]interface{}, error) { // Your code will be injected here. } The parameters the function receives are:\nd: Terraform resource data. Use d.Get(\u0026quot;field_name\u0026quot;) to get a field\u0026rsquo;s current value. meta: Can be cast to a Config object (which can make API calls) using meta.(*transport_tpg.Config) res: The data (\u0026ldquo;response\u0026rdquo;) returned by the API. The function returns data that will be set in Terraform state and an optional error.\nModify the API response value for a specific field # - name: \u0026#39;FIELD\u0026#39; type: String custom_flatten: \u0026#39;templates/terraform/custom_flatten/PRODUCT_RESOURCE_FIELD.go.tmpl\u0026#39; Set custom_flatten on a field to inject code that modifies the value returned by the API prior to storing it in Terraform state. Custom flatteners run after any decoder. The referenced file must include the function signature for the flattener. For example:\nfunc flatten{{$.GetPrefix}}{{$.TitlelizeProperty}}(v interface{}, d *schema.ResourceData, config *transport_tpg.Config) interface{} { if v == nil { return \u0026#34;0\u0026#34; } return v } The parameters the function receives are:\nv: The value for the field d: Terraform resource data. Use d.Get(\u0026quot;field_name\u0026quot;) to get a field\u0026rsquo;s current value. config: Config object. Can be used to make API calls. The function returns a final value that will be stored in Terraform state for the field, which will be compared with the user\u0026rsquo;s configuration to determine if there is a diff.\nInject code before / after CRUD operations and Import # custom_code: pre_create: templates/terraform/pre_create/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl post_create: templates/terraform/post_create/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl pre_read: templates/terraform/pre_read/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl pre_update: templates/terraform/pre_update/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl post_update: templates/terraform/post_update/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl pre_delete: templates/terraform/pre_delete/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl post_delete: templates/terraform/post_delete/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl post_import: templates/terraform/post_import/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl CRUD operations can be modified with pre/post hooks. This code will be injected directly into the relevant CRUD method as close as possible to the related API call and will have access to any variables that are present when it runs. pre_create and pre_update run after any encoder. Some example use cases:\nUse post_create to set an update-only field after create finishes. Use pre_delete to detach a disk before deleting it. Use post_import to parse attributes from the import ID and call d.Set(\u0026quot;field\u0026quot;) so that the resource can be read from the API. Custom create error handling # custom_code: post_create_failure: templates/terraform/post_create_failure/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl Use custom_code.post_create_failure to inject code that runs if a Create request to the API returns an error.\nThe post_create_failure code will be wrapped in a function like:\nfunc resourceProductResourcePostCreateFailure(d *schema.ResourceData, meta interface{}) { // Your code will be injected here. } The parameters the function receives are:\nd: Terraform resource data. Use d.Get(\u0026quot;field_name\u0026quot;) to get a field\u0026rsquo;s current value. meta: Can be cast to a Config object (which can make API calls) using meta.(*transport_tpg.Config) Replace entire CRUD methods # custom_code: custom_create: templates/terraform/custom_create/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl custom_update: templates/terraform/custom_update/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl custom_delete: templates/terraform/custom_delete/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl custom_import: templates/terraform/custom_import/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl Custom methods replace the entire contents of the Create, Update, Delete, or Import methods. For example:\nfunc resourceProductResourceImport(d *schema.ResourceData, meta interface{}) ([]*schema.ResourceData, error) { // Your code will be injected here. } Custom methods are similar to handwritten code and should be avoided if possible. If you have to replace two or more methods, the resource should be handwritten instead.\nAdd extra fields to a resource # Use custom_code.extra_schema_entry to add additional fields to a resource. Do not use extra_schema_entry unless there is no other option. The extra fields are injected at the end of the resource\u0026rsquo;s Schema field. They should be formatted as entries in the map. For example:\n\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;: \u0026amp;schema.Schema{ ... }, Any fields added in this way will need to be have documentation manually added using the top-level docs field:\ndocs: optional_properties: | * `FIELD_NAME` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html)) FIELD_DESCRIPTION See Add documentation (Handwritten) for more information about what to include in the field documentation.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? # Add tests Run tests "},{"id":19,"href":"/magic-modules/develop/add-handwritten-datasource/","title":"Add a datasource","section":"Develop","content":" Add a datasource # Note: only handwritten datasources are currently supported\nDatasources are like terraform resources except they don\u0026rsquo;t create anything. They are simply read-only operations that will expose some sort of values needed for subsequent resource operations. If you\u0026rsquo;re adding a field to an existing datasource, check the Resource section. Everything there will be mostly consistent with the type of change you\u0026rsquo;ll need to make. For adding a new datasource there are 5 steps to doing so.\nCreate a new datasource declaration file and a corresponding test file Add Schema and Read operation implementation If there is labels field with type KeyValueLabels in the corresponding resource, in the datasource Read operation implementation, after the resource read method, call the function tpgresource.SetDataSourceLabels(d) to make labels and terraform_labels have all of the labels on the resource. If there is annotations field with type KeyValueAnnotations in the corresponding resource, in the datasource Read operation implementation, after the resource read method, call the function tpgresource.SetDataSourceAnnotations(d) to make annotations have all of the annotations on the resource. Register the datasource to handwrittenDatasources in magic-modules/mmv1/third_party/terraform/provider/provider_mmv1_resources.go.tmpl Implement a test which will create and resources and read the corresponding datasource Add documentation For creating a datasource based off an existing resource you can make use of the schema directly. Otherwise implementing the schema directly, similar to normal resource creation, is the desired path.\nResourceless Datasources # Datasources not backed by a resource are possible to add as well. They follow the same general steps as adding a resource-based datasource, except that a full Read method will need to be defined for them rather than calling a resource\u0026rsquo;s Read method.\nNote that while resource-based datasources can depend on the resource read method for API calls, resourceless datasources need to make them themselves. An HTTP-based client that\u0026rsquo;s properly configured with logging and retries must be used, such as a client from the https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-go-client library, or the raw HTTP client used in MMV1 through SendRequest.\nAdd documentation # Open the data source documentation in magic-modules/third_party/terraform/website/docs/d/ using an editor of your choice.

They manifest as diffs at plan time on fields that a user has not modified in their configuration. They can also show up as test failures with the error message: \u0026ldquo;After applying this test step, the plan was not empty.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a general sense, permadiffs are caused by the API returning a different value for the field than what the user sent, which causes Terraform to try to re-send the same request, which gets the same response, which continues to result in the user seeing a diff. In general, APIs that return exactly what the user sent are more friendly for Terraform or other declarative tooling. However, many GCP APIs normalize inputs, have server-side defaults that are returned to the user, do not return all the fields set on a resource, or return data in a different format in some other way.\nThis page outlines best practices for working around various types of permadiffs in the google and google-beta providers.\nAPI returns default value for unset field # For new fields, if possible, set a client-side default that matches the API default. This will prevent the diff and will allow users to accurately see what the end state will be if the field is not set in their configuration. A client-side default should only be used if the API sets the same default value in all cases and the default value will be stable over time. Changing a client-side default is a breaking change.\nMMv1 default_value: DEFAULT_VALUE In the providers, this will be converted to:\n\u0026#34;field\u0026#34;: { // ...

Default: \u0026#34;DEFAULT_VALUE\u0026#34;, } See SDKv2 Schema Behaviors - Default ↗ for more information.\nFor existing fields (or new fields that are not eligible for a client-side default), mark the field as having an API-side default. If the field is not set (or is set to an \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; value such as zero, false, or an empty string) the provider will treat the most recent value returned by the API as the value for the field, and will send that value for the field on subsequent requests. The field will show as (known after apply) in plans and it will not be possible for the user to explicitly set the field to an \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; value.\nMMv1 default_from_api: true In the providers, this will be converted to:\n\u0026#34;field\u0026#34;: { // ...

This will also simplify diffs if new values are added or removed. Imported resources will not have access to a configuration, so the field will be sorted alphabetically.

To add or update provider dependencies, use standard Go tooling to update the dependency in the terraform-provider-google provider and copy the results to the upstream files in Magic Modules.\nBelow are the steps you can follow to make the change:\nNavigate to the local google provider directory: cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google Open the go.mod file and add the new entries or modify the versions of existing entries as needed Update dependencies using either of the following methods run the following commands to update all dependencies: go get go mod tidy Alternatively, update a specific package to a desired version: go get google.golang.org/api@v0.105.0 go mod tidy Copy the contents of the updated go.mod and go.sum file into mmv1/third_party/terraform/go.mod and mmv1/third_party/terraform/go.sum in the magic-modules respectively. Create a pull request containing only the dependency changes. Resolve any errors caused by the dependency upgrade. After the dependency pull request is merged, continue with a separate pull request for any additional changes that were blocked by the upgrade. "},{"id":28,"href":"/magic-modules/develop/client-side-fields/","title":"Client-side fields","section":"Develop","content":" Client-side fields # Client-side fields are most often used as flags to modify the behavior of a Terraform resource. Because they don\u0026rsquo;t correspond to an API field, there are some additional considerations in terms of how to implement them.\nCommon client-side fields include:\ndeletion_protection deletion_policy MMv1 Add to the schema # Instead of adding the field in parameters or properties, use a section called virtual_fields.\nExample:\nvirtual_fields: - name: \u0026#39;deletion_protection\u0026#39; type: Boolean default_value: true description: | Whether Terraform will be prevented from destroying the CertificateAuthority. When the field is set to true or unset in Terraform state, a `terraform apply` or `terraform destroy` that would delete the CertificateAuthority will fail. When the field is set to false, deleting the CertificateAuthority is allowed. This will automatically ensure that the field works as users expect.\nHandwritten Add to the schema # Add the field to the schema as usual.\nExample:\n\u0026#34;deletion_protection\u0026#34;: { Type: schema.TypeBool, Optional: true, Default: true, Description: `Whether Terraform will be prevented from destroying the instance. When the field is set to true or unset in Terraform state, a terraform apply or terraform destroy that would delete the table will fail. When the field is set to false, deleting the table is allowed.`, }, Set on read # For fields with default values, you need to explicitly set client-side fields in the Read function to avoid a diff that \u0026ldquo;sets\u0026rdquo; the field to its default value when users upgrade to the version that contains the new field.\nExample:\n// Explicitly set client-side fields to default values if unset if _, ok := d.GetOkExists(\u0026#34;deletion_protection\u0026#34;); !ok { if err := d.Set(\u0026#34;deletion_protection\u0026#34;, true); err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;Error setting deletion_protection: %s\u0026#34;, err) } } Short-circuit updates if only client-side fields were modified # Client-side fields can always be updated in-place. However, if the resource is otherwise immutable, you will need to ensure that an Update function is present for the resource. Terraform automatically updates the state based on the plan; this does not need to happen in the Update function unless the value for a field might have changed (for example, based on an API response, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t apply to client-side fields).\nIf only client-side fields were modified, you can short-circuit the Update function to avoid sending an API request. This is important because the update request will be empty (which causes errors for some APIs.) This can go at the top of the Update function:\nclientSideFields := map[string]bool{\u0026#34;deletion_protection\u0026#34;: true} clientSideOnly := true for field := range ResourceSpannerInstance().Schema { if d.HasChange(field) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !clientSideFields[field] { clientSideOnly = false break } } if clientSideOnly { return nil } Replace ResourceSpannerInstance with the appropriate resource function.\nUpdate data source # If the resource has a corresponding data source that calls the resource\u0026rsquo;s Read function, you will need to make the following changes to the data source:\nAdd the client-side field to the data source\u0026rsquo;s Schema as an output-only field. (This will happen automatically for data sources that use tpgresource.DatasourceSchemaFromResourceSchema.)\n\u0026#34;deletion_protection\u0026#34;: { Type: schema.TypeBool, Computed: true, }, Unset the field in the data source\u0026rsquo;s Read function.\nif err := d.Set(\u0026#34;deletion_protection\u0026#34;, nil); err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;Error setting deletion_protection: %s\u0026#34;, err) } Implement logic # At this point, you should be ready to implement your logic! For example, a deletion_protection field short-ciruits the deletion process if it is not explicitly set to false.\nMMv1 Add the following as pre_delete custom code.\nif d.Get(\u0026#34;deletion_protection\u0026#34;).(bool) { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;cannot destroy folder without setting deletion_protection=false and running `terraform apply`\u0026#34;) } Handwritten Add the following at the beginning of the resource\u0026rsquo;s Delete function.\nif d.Get(\u0026#34;deletion_protection\u0026#34;).(bool) { return fmt.Errorf(\u0026#34;cannot destroy folder without setting deletion_protection=false and running `terraform apply`\u0026#34;) } "}]
