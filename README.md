# Magic Modules

Magic Modules is a code generator and CI system that's used to develop the Terraform providers
for Google Platform, [`google`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google) (or TPG) and
[`google-beta`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta) (or TPGB).

Magic Modules allows contributors to make changes against a single codebase and develop both
provider versions simultaneously. After sending a pull request against this repository, the
`modular-magician` robot user will manage (most of) the heavy lifting from generating a
complete output, running presubmit tests, and updating the providers following your
change.

## Getting Started with Magic Modules

### Preparing your environment

To get started, you'll need:

* Go
  * If you're using a Mac with Homebrew installed, you can follow these
    instructions to set up Go: [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQVyvulNnzs).
  * If you're using Cloud Shell, Go is already installed.
* Ruby 2.6.0
  * You can use [`rbenv`](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage your Ruby version(s).
  * To install `rbenv`:
    * Homebrew: run `brew install rbenv ruby-build`
    * Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives: run `sudo apt install rbenv`
  * Then run `rbenv install 2.6.0`. 
    * For M1 Mac users, run `RUBY_CFLAGS="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration" rbenv install 2.6.0`
* [`Bundler`](https://github.com/bundler/bundler)
  * This can be installed with `gem install bundler`
* Goimports
  * go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports / go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
* Terraform
  * [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
* If you are getting "Too many open files" ulimit needs to be raised.
  * Mac OSX: `ulimit -n 1000`

### Preparing Magic Modules / One-time setup

**Important:**
Compiling Magic Modules can be done directly from the `mmv1` directory within this repository.
In the future we will add hybrid generation with multiple generators. All the information below
pertains only to the contents of the `mmv1` directory, and commands should be executed from
that directory.

To get started right away, use the bootstrap script with:

```bash
cd mmv1
./tools/bootstrap
```

---

Otherwise, follow the manual steps below:

If you're generating the Terraform providers (`google` and `google-beta`),
you'll need to check out the repo(s) you're generating in your GOPATH. For
example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google
git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta
```

Magic Modules won't work with old versions of the Terraform provider repos. If
you're encountering issues with vendoring and paths, make sure both MM and the
Terraform provider are running on up to date copies of `main`.

Once you've prepared the target folders for the tools, run the following to
finish getting Magic Modules set up by installing the Ruby gems it needs to run:

```bash
cd mmv1
bundle install
```

Now, you can verify you're ready with:

```bash
./tools/doctor
```

<details><summary>Expected output:</summary>

```
Check for rbenv in path...
   found!
Checking ruby version...
2.6.0 (set by [PATH]/magic-modules/mmv1/.ruby-version)
Check for bundler in path...
   found!
Check for go in path...
   found!
Check for goimports in path...
   found!
Check for git in path...
   found!
```
</details>

---

### Generating the Terraform Providers

Before making any changes, you can compile the Terraform provider you're working
on by running the following command. If Magic Modules has been installed
correctly, you'll get no errors.

The following commands should be run from the root directory of the repository.
OUTPUT_PATH should be set to the location of your provider repository, which is
recommended to be inside your GOPATH.

```bash
cd magic-modules

make terraform VERSION=ga OUTPUT_PATH="$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google"
make terraform VERSION=beta OUTPUT_PATH="$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta"

# Only generate a specific product (plus all common files)
make terraform VERSION=ga OUTPUT_PATH="$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google" PRODUCT=dataproc
```

It's worth noting that Magic Modules will only generate new files when run
locally. The "Magician"- the Magic Modules CI system- handles deletion of old
files when creating PRs.

---

### Testing

Once you've made changes to resource definition, you can run Magic Modules
to generate changes to your tool; see
["Generating the Terraform Providers"](#generating-the-terraform-providers)
above if you need a refresher. Once it's generated, you should run the
tool-specific tests as if you were submitting a PR against that tool.

You can run tests in the `{{output_folder}}` you generated the tool in.
See the following tool-specific documentation for more details on testing that
tool;

Tool             | Testing Guide
-----------------|--------------
terraform        | [`google` provider testing guide](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests)
terraform (beta) | [`google-beta` provider testing guide](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests)

Don't worry about testing every tool, only the primary tool you're making
changes against. The Magic Modules maintainers will ensure your changes work
against each tool.

If your changes have unintended consequences in another tool, a reviewer will
instruct you to mark the field excluded or provide specific feedback on what
changes to make to the tool-specific overrides in order for them to work
correctly.

#### Using released terraform binary with local provider binary

Setup:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google/5.0.0/darwin_amd64
mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google-beta/5.0.0/darwin_amd64
ln -s $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-google ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google/5.0.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-google_v5.0.0
ln -s $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-google-beta ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/google-beta/5.0.0/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-google-beta_v5.0.0
```

Once this setup is complete, terraform will automatically use the binaries generated by the `make build` commands in the `terraform-provider-google` and `terraform-provider-google-beta` repositories instead of downloading the latest versions. To undo this, you can run:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/
```

For more information, check out Hashicorp's documentation on the [0.13+ filesystem layout](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html#new-filesystem-layout-for-local-copies-of-providers).

If multiple versions are available in a plugin directory (for example after `terraform providers mirror` is used), Terraform will pick the most up-to-date provider version within version constraints. As such, we recommend using a version that is several major versions ahead for your local copy of the provider, such as `5.0.0`.

---

### Submitting a PR

Before creating a commit, if you've modified any .rb files, make sure you run
`rake test`! That will run rubocop to ensure that the code you've written will
pass Travis.

To run rubocop automatically before committing, add a Git pre-commit hook with:

```bash
cp .github/pre-commit .git/hooks
```

Once you've created your commit(s), you can submit the code normally as a PR in
the GitHub UI. The PR template includes some instructions to make sure we
generate good PR messages for the tools' repo histories.

Once your PR is submitted, one of the Magic Modules maintainers will review it.
They'll look over the code before running the "Magician", the Magic Modules CI
system that generates PRs against each tool. Each review pass, your reviewer
will run the Magician again to update the PRs against the tools.

If there are multiple tools affected, that first reviewer will be the "primary"
reviewer, and for each other affected tool a maintainer for that specific tool
will make a pass. The primary reviewer will make it clear which other
maintainers need to review, and prompt them to review your code; you will
communicate primarily with the first reviewer.

Even when multiple tools are affected, this will generally be a quick look by
that maintainer with no changes needing to be made.

Once you've gotten approvals from the primary reviewer and the reviewers for
any affected tools, the primary reviewer will merge your changes.

## Contributing

### General contributing steps

1. Fork `Magic Modules` repository into your GitHub account if you haven't done before.
1. Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues) to see whether your feature has already been requested.
   * if there's an issue and it's already has a dedicated assignee, it indicates that someone may have already started to work on a solution.
   * otherwise, you're welcome to work on the issue.
1. Check whether the resource you would like to work on already exists in the providers ([`google`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google) / [`google-beta`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta) or [check the website](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs)).
   * If it exists, check the header of the downstream file to identify the type of tools used to generate the resource. For some resources, the code file, the test file and the documentation file may not be generated via the same tools.
      * Generated resources like [`google_compute_address`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_address) can be identified by looking in their [`Go source`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/blob/main/google/resource_compute_address.go) for an `AUTO GENERATED CODE` header as well as a `Type`. "Generated resources" typically refers to just the `MMv1` type, and `DCL` type resources are considered "DCL-based". (Currently DCL-related contribution are not supported)
      * Handwritten resources like [`google_container_cluster`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/container_cluster) can be identified if they have source code present under the [`mmv1/third_party/terraform/resources`](./mmv1/third_party/terraform/resources) folder or by the absence of the `AUTO GENERATED CODE header` in their [`Go source`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/blob/main/google/resource_container_cluster.go).
   * If not, decide which tool you would like to use to implement the resource. 
      * MMv1 is strongly preferred over handwriting the resource unless the resource can not be generated.
      * Currently, only handwritten datasources are supported.
1. Make the actual code change.
   * The [Contribution Guide](#contribution-guide) below will guide you to the detailed instructions on how to make your change, based on the type of the change + the tool used to generate the code.
1. Build the providers that includes your change. Check [Generating the Terraform Providers](#generating-the-terraform-providers) section for details on how to generate the providers locally.
1. Test the feature against the providers you generated in the last step locally. Check [Testing Guidance](#testing) for details on how to run provider test locally. (Testing the PR locally and pushing the commit to the PR only after the tests pass locally may significantly reduce review cycles)
1. Push your changes to your `magic-modules` repo fork and send a pull request from that branch to the main branch on `magic-modules`. A reviewer will be assigned automatically to your PR. Check [Submitting a PR](#submitting-a-PR) section for details on how to submit a PR.
1. Wait until the the modules magician to generate downstream diff (which should takes about 15 mins after creating the PR) to make sure all changes are generated correctly in downstream repos.
1. Wait for the VCR test results.
   <details><summary>Get to know general workflow for VCR tests</summary>

      1. You submit your change.
      1. The recorded tests are ran against your changes by the `modular-magician`. Tests will fail if:
         1. Your PR has changed the HTTP request values sent by the provider
         1. Your PR does not change the HTTP request values, but fails on the values returned in an old recording
         1. The recordings are out of sync with the merge-base of your PR, and an unrelated contributor's change has caused a false positive
      1. The `modular-magician` will leave a message indicating the number of passing and failing VCR tests. If there is a failure, the `modular-magician` user will leave a message indicating the "`Triggering VCR tests in RECORDING mode for the following tests that failed during VCR:`" marking which tests failed.
         1. If a test does not appear related, it probably isn't!
      1. The `modular-magician` will kick off a second test run targeting only the failed tests, this time hitting the live GCP APIs. If there are tests that fail at this point, a message stating `Tests failed during RECORDING mode:` will be left indicating the tests.
         1. If a test that appears to be related to your change has failed here, it's likely your change has introduced an issue. You can view the debug logs for the test by clicking the "view" link beside the test case to attempt to debug what's going wrong.
         1. If a test appears to be completely unrelated has failed, it's possible that a GCP API has changed in a way that broke the provider or our environment capped on a quota.
   </details>

   Where possible, take a look at the logs and see if you can figure out what needs to be fixed related to your change.
   The false positive rate on these tests is extremely high between changes in the API, Cloud Build bugs, and eventual consistency issues in test recordings so we don't expect contributors to wholly interpret the results- that's the responsibility of your reviewer.
1. If your assigned reviewers does not reply/ review within a week, gently ping them on github.
1. After your PR is merged, it will be released to customers in around a week or two.
