# A 'resource' is a provider/consumer of data. Commonly these are git repos.
# Somewhat confusingly, resources can both produce data and consume data (e.g.
# git repos can provide code to concourse to compile, but can also create tags
# or branches). Not all resources support both input and output.
#
# See https://concourse.ci/resource-types.html for more.
