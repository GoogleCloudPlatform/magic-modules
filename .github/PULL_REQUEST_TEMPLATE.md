NO CHANGELOG NOTE: Please add "changelog: no-release-note" label to this PR.

Otherwise, fill the template out (replace the heading).
You can add more release notes if you want more than one CHANGELOG entry for
this PR, but make sure not to indent notes and to leave newlines between
code blocks for Markdown's sake.

For Terraform PRs, we use the following "release-note:" headings
    - release-note:bug
    - release-note:note
    - release-note:new-resource
    - release-note:new-datasource
    - release-note:deprecation
    - release-note:breaking-change
-->
