If this PR is for Terraform, I acknowledge that I have:

- [ ] Searched through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues) for an open issue that this either resolves or contributes to, commented on it to claim it, and written "fixes {url}" or "part of {url}" in this PR description. If there were no relevant open issues, I opened one and commented that I would like to work on it (not necessary for very small changes).
- [ ] [Generated Terraform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules#generating-downstream-tools), and ran `make test` and `make lint` to ensure it passes unit and linter tests.
- [ ] Ensured that all new fields I added that can be set by a user appear in at least one [example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/tree/master/templates/terraform/examples) (for generated resources) or [third_party test](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/tree/master/third_party/terraform/tests) (for handwritten resources or update tests).
- [ ] [Ran](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#tests) relevant acceptance tests (If the acceptance tests do not yet pass or you are unable to run them, please let your reviewer know).
- [ ] Read the [Release Notes Guide](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/blob/master/.ci/RELEASE_NOTES_GUIDE.md) before writing my release note below.
