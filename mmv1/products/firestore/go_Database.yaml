  A Cloud Firestore Database.

  If you wish to use Firestore with App Engine, use the
  [`google_app_engine_application`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/app_engine_application)
  resource instead. If you were previously using the `google_app_engine_application` resource exclusively for managing a Firestore database
  and would like to use the `google_firestore_database` resource instead, please follow the instructions
  [here](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/app-engine-requirement).

      Deletion behavior for this database.

      If the deletion policy is `DELETE`, the database will both be removed from Terraform state and deleted from Google Cloud upon destruction.
      The default value is `ABANDON`.
      See also `delete_protection`.

      a letter and the last a letter or a number. Must not be

      If `POINT_IN_TIME_RECOVERY_ENABLED` is selected, reads are supported on selected versions of the data from within the past 7 days.
      versionRetentionPeriod and earliestVersionTime can be used to determine the supported versions. These include reads against any timestamp within the past hour
      and reads against 1-minute snapshots beyond 1 hour and within 7 days.
      If `POINT_IN_TIME_RECOVERY_DISABLED` is selected, reads are supported on any version of the data from within the past 1 hour.

      The default value is `DELETE_PROTECTION_STATE_UNSPECIFIED`, which is currently equivalent to `DELETE_PROTECTION_DISABLED`.

      Output only. The period during which past versions of data are retained in the database.
      Any read or query can specify a readTime within this window, and will read the state of the database at that time.
      If the PITR feature is enabled, the retention period is 7 days. Otherwise, the retention period is 1 hour.
      A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with 's'. Example: "3.5s".
    output: true
  - name: 'earliestVersionTime'
    type: String
    description: |
      Output only. The earliest timestamp at which older versions of the data can be read from the database. See versionRetentionPeriod above; this field is populated with now - versionRetentionPeriod.
      This value is continuously updated, and becomes stale the moment it is queried. If you are using this value to recover data, make sure to account for the time from the moment when the value is queried to the moment when you initiate the recovery.
      A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

          this key. This feature is allowlist only in initial launch.

          Only keys in the same location as this database are allowed to be used
          for encryption. For Firestore's nam5 multi-region, this corresponds to Cloud KMS
          multi-region us. For Firestore's eur3 multi-region, this corresponds to
          Cloud KMS multi-region europe. See https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/locations.

          This value should be the KMS key resource ID in the format of
          `projects/{project_id}/locations/{kms_location}/keyRings/{key_ring}/cryptoKeys/{crypto_key}`.
          How to retrive this resource ID is listed at
