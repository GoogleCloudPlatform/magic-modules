      Represents a collection of external workforces. Provides namespaces for
      federated users that can be referenced in IAM policies.
      Note: Ask your Google Cloud account team to request access to workforce identity
      federation for your billing/quota project. The account team notifies you when the project is
      granted access.

             existing tokens to access resources. If the pool is undeleted, existing
             tokens grant access again.
