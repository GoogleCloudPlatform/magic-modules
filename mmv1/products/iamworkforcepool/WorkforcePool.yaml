    description: |
      Output only. The state of the pool.
       * STATE_UNSPECIFIED: State unspecified.
       * ACTIVE: The pool is active, and may be used in Google Cloud policies.
       * DELETED: The pool is soft-deleted. Soft-deleted pools are permanently deleted
         after approximately 30 days. You can restore a soft-deleted pool using
         [workforcePools.undelete](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/reference/rest/v1/locations.workforcePools/undelete#google.iam.admin.v1.WorkforcePools.UndeleteWorkforcePool).
         You cannot reuse the ID of a soft-deleted pool until it is permanently deleted.
         While a pool is deleted, you cannot use it to exchange tokens, or use
         existing tokens to access resources. If the pool is undeleted, existing
         tokens grant access again.
