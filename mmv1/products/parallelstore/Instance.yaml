    name: labels
    description: 'Optional. Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for
      organizing cloud resources into groups that reflect a customer''s organizational
      needs and deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections
      of resources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated.
      And they can be used as arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route, firewall,
      load balancing, etc.). * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and
      must conform to the following regular expression: `a-z{0,62}`. * Label values
      must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform to the regular expression
      `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`. * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource.
      See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels. If you
      plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional characters may
      be allowed in the future. Therefore, you are advised to use an internal label
      representation, such as JSON, which doesn''t rely upon specific characters being
      disallowed. For example, representing labels as the string: name + "_" + value
      would prove problematic if we were to allow "_" in a future release.'
