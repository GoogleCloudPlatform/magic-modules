    type: KeyValueLabels
    description: |
      Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for
      organizing cloud resources into groups that reflect a customer's organizational
      needs and deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections
      of resources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated.
      And they can be used as arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route, firewall,
      load balancing, etc.).

      * Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to
       the following regular expression: `a-z{0,62}`.
      * Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform
       to the regular expression `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`.
      * No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource.

      See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.

      If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional
      characters may be allowed in the future. Therefore, you are advised to use
      an internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon
      specific characters being disallowed.  For example, representing labels
      as the string:  `name + "_" + value` would prove problematic if we were to
      allow `"_"` in a future release. "
