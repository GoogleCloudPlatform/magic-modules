  - name: 'attestationAuthority'
    type: NestedObject
    description: |
      Note kind that represents a logical attestation "role" or "authority".
      For example, an organization might have one AttestationAuthority for
      "QA" and one for "build". This Note is intended to act strictly as a
      grouping mechanism for the attached Occurrences (Attestations). This
      grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs
      gate the ability for a principle to attach an Occurrence to a given
      Note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached
      Attestation Occurrences, even if they don't all live in the same
      project.
    required: true
    properties:
      - name: 'hint'
        type: NestedObject
        description: |
          This submessage provides human-readable hints about the purpose of
          the AttestationAuthority. Because the name of a Note acts as its
          resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical
          name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes)
          from "readable" names more suitable for debug output. Note that
          these hints should NOT be used to look up AttestationAuthorities
          in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up
          Attestations to verify.
        required: true
        properties:
          - name: 'humanReadableName'
            type: String
            description: |
              The human readable name of this Attestation Authority, for
              example "qa".
            required: true
