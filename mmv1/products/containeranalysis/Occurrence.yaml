    name: attestation
    description: |
      Occurrence that represents a single "attestation". The authenticity
      of an attestation can be verified using the attached signature.
      If the verifier trusts the public key of the signer, then verifying
      the signature is sufficient to establish trust. In this circumstance,
      the authority to which this attestation is attached is primarily
      useful for lookup (how to find this attestation if you already
      know the authority and artifact to be verified) and intent (for
      which authority this attestation was intended to sign.

    properties:

        description: |
          The serialized payload that is verified by one or
          more signatures. A base64-encoded string.
        required: true
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Array
        name: signatures
        description: |
          One or more signatures over serializedPayload.
          Verifier implementations should consider this attestation
          message verified if at least one signature verifies
          serializedPayload. See Signature in common.proto for more
          details on signature structure and verification.

                The content of the signature, an opaque bytestring.
                The payload that this signature verifies MUST be
                unambiguously provided with the Signature during
                verification. A wrapper message might provide the
                payload explicitly. Alternatively, a message might
                have a canonical serialization that can always be
                unambiguously computed to derive the payload.

                The identifier for the public key that verifies this
                signature. MUST be an RFC3986 conformant
                URI. * When possible, the key id should be an
                immutable reference, such as a cryptographic digest.
                Examples of valid values:

                * OpenPGP V4 public key fingerprint. See https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/prov/openpgp4fpr
                  for more details on this scheme.
