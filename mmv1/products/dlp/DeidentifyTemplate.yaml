                            The custom info type to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom info type followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: {info type name}({surrogate character count}):{surrogate}

                            For example, if the name of custom info type is 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE(3):abc'

                            This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom info type 'Surrogate'. This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.

                            Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free form text.

                            In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either

                            *   reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier
                            *   be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error

                            Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY\_TOKEN\_TYPE.

                            The custom infoType to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom infoType followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: info\_type\_name(surrogate\_character\_count):surrogate

                            For example, if the name of custom infoType is 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE(3):abc'

                            This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom infoType [`SurrogateType`](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#surrogatetype). This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.

                            In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY\_TOKEN\_TYPE

                        Buckets values based on fixed size ranges. The Bucketing transformation can provide all of this functionality, but requires more configuration. This message is provided as a convenience to the user for simple bucketing strategies.

                        The transformed value will be a hyphenated string of {lower_bound}-{upper_bound}. For example, if lower_bound = 10 and upper_bound = 20, all values that are within this bucket will be replaced with "10-20".

                        This can be used on data of type: double, long.

                        If the bound Value type differs from the type of data being transformed, we will first attempt converting the type of the data to be transformed to match the type of the bound before comparing.

                            - `number_to_mask` is -4

                            - Input string is 1234-5678-9012-3456

                            The resulting de-identified string is ****-****-****-3456. Cloud DLP masks all but the last four characters. If reverseOrder is true, all but the first four characters are masked as 1234-****-****-****.

                            The custom infoType to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom infoType followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: info\_type\_name(surrogate\_character\_count):surrogate

                            For example, if the name of custom infoType is 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE(3):abc'

                            This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom infoType [`SurrogateType`](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#surrogatetype). This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.

                            In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY\_TOKEN\_TYPE

                            The custom info type to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom info type followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: {info type name}({surrogate character count}):{surrogate}

                            For example, if the name of custom info type is 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE(3):abc'

                            This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom info type 'Surrogate'. This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.

                            Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free form text.

                            In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either

                            *   reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier
                            *   be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error

                            Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY\_TOKEN\_TYPE.

                                  Partially mask a string by replacing a given number of characters with a fixed character. Masking can start from the beginning or end of the string. This can be used on data of any type (numbers, longs, and so on) and when de-identifying structured data we'll attempt to preserve the original data's type. (This allows you to take a long like 123 and modify it to a string like **3).

                                      If number_to_mask is negative, this denotes inverse masking. Cloud DLP masks all but a number of characters. For example, suppose you have the following values:

                                  Replaces an identifier with a surrogate using Format Preserving Encryption (FPE) with the FFX mode of operation; however when used in the `content.reidentify` API method, it serves the opposite function by reversing the surrogate back into the original identifier. The identifier must be encoded as ASCII. For a given crypto key and context, the same identifier will be replaced with the same surrogate. Identifiers must be at least two characters long. In the case that the identifier is the empty string, it will be skipped. See [https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/pseudonymization](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/pseudonymization) to learn more.

This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom infoType followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: info\_type\_name(surrogate\_character\_count):surrogate

                                      For example, if the name of custom infoType is 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE(3):abc'

                                      This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom infoType [`SurrogateType`](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#surrogatetype). This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.

                                      In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY\_TOKEN\_TYPE

                                      The custom info type to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom info type followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: {info type name}({surrogate character count}):{surrogate}

                                      For example, if the name of custom info type is 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE(3):abc'

                                      This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom info type 'Surrogate'. This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.

                                      Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free form text.

                                      In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either

                                      *   reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier
                                      *   be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error

                                      Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY\_TOKEN\_TYPE.
