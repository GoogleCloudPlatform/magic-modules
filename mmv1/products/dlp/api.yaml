                          timestamp property does not exist or its value is empty or invalid.

                                  Increase or decrease the likelihood by the specified number of levels. For example,
                                  if a finding would be POSSIBLE without the detection rule and relativeLikelihood is 1,
                                  then it is upgraded to LIKELY, while a value of -1 would downgrade it to UNLIKELY.
                                  Likelihood may never drop below VERY_UNLIKELY or exceed VERY_LIKELY, so applying an
                                  adjustment of 1 followed by an adjustment of -1 when base likelihood is VERY_LIKELY
                                  will result in a final likelihood of LIKELY. Either this or fixed_likelihood can be set.

                                The custom info type to annotate the surrogate with. This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom info type followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: {info type name}({surrogate character count}):{surrogate}

                                For example, if the name of custom info type is 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE(3):abc'

                                This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom info type 'Surrogate'. This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.

                                Note: For record transformations where the entire cell in a table is being transformed, surrogates are not mandatory. Surrogates are used to denote the location of the token and are necessary for re-identification in free form text.

                                In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this info type must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may either

                                *   reverse a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier
                                *   be unable to parse the surrogate and result in an error

                                Therefore, choose your custom info type name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY\_TOKEN\_TYPE.

The identifier must be encoded as ASCII. For a given crypto key and context, the same identifier will be replaced with the same surrogate. Identifiers must be at least two characters long. In the case that the identifier is the empty string, it will be skipped. See [https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/pseudonymization](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/pseudonymization) to learn more.

This annotation will be applied to the surrogate by prefixing it with the name of the custom infoType followed by the number of characters comprising the surrogate. The following scheme defines the format: info\_type\_name(surrogate\_character\_count):surrogate

                                For example, if the name of custom infoType is 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE' and the surrogate is 'abc', the full replacement value will be: 'MY\_TOKEN\_INFO\_TYPE(3):abc'

                                This annotation identifies the surrogate when inspecting content using the custom infoType [`SurrogateType`](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/InspectConfig#surrogatetype). This facilitates reversal of the surrogate when it occurs in free text.

                                In order for inspection to work properly, the name of this infoType must not occur naturally anywhere in your data; otherwise, inspection may find a surrogate that does not correspond to an actual identifier. Therefore, choose your custom infoType name carefully after considering what your data looks like. One way to select a name that has a high chance of yielding reliable detection is to include one or more unicode characters that are highly improbable to exist in your data. For example, assuming your data is entered from a regular ASCII keyboard, the symbol with the hex code point 29DD might be used like so: ⧝MY\_TOKEN\_TYPE

Either a name of your choosing when creating a CustomInfoType, or one of the names listed at [https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/infotypes-reference) when specifying a built-in type. When sending Cloud DLP results to Data Catalog, infoType names should conform to the pattern `[A-Za-z0-9$-_]{1,64}`.

Each character listed must appear only once. Number of characters must be in the range \[2, 95\]. This must be encoded as ASCII. The order of characters does not matter.
