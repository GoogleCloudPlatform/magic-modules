                    CustomInfoType can either be a new infoType, or an extension of built-in infoType, when the name matches one of existing
                    infoTypes and that infoType is specified in `info_types` field. Specifying the latter adds findings to the
                    one detected by the system. If built-in info type is not specified in `info_types` list then the name is
                    treated as a custom info type.
