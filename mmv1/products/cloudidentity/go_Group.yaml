          The ID of the entity.

          For Google-managed entities, the id must be the email address of an existing
          group or user.

          such as a Google user or a Google Group.

          If specified, the EntityKey represents an external-identity-mapped group.
          The namespace must correspond to an identity source created in Admin Console
          and must be in the form of `identitysources/{identity_source_id}`.
        immutable: true

      Existing Google Groups can have an additional label with a key of cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.security and an empty value added to them. This is an immutable change and the security label cannot be removed once added.

      Dynamic groups have a label with a key of cloudidentity.googleapis.com/groups.dynamic.
