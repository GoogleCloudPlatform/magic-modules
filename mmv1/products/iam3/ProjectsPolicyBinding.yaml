      Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language
      (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of
      CEL are documented at https://github.com/google/cel-spec.
      Example (Comparison):
      title: \"Summary size limit\"
      description: \"Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars\"
      expression: \"document.summary.size() < 100\"
      Example
      (Equality):
      title: \"Requestor is owner\"
      description: \"Determines if requestor is the document owner\"
      expression: \"document.owner == request.auth.claims.email\"  Example
      (Logic):
      title: \"Public documents\"
      description: \"Determine whether the document should be publicly visible\"
      expression: \"document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'\"
      Example (Data Manipulation):
      title: \"Notification string\"
      description: \"Create a notification string with a timestamp.\"
      expression: \"'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)\"
      The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are
      determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for
      additional information.
    properties:
      - name: 'expression'
        type: String

          Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax.
      - name: 'title'
        type: String
        description: |
          Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression.
      - name: 'description'
        type: String
        description: |
          Optional. Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.
      - name: 'location'
        type: String
        description: |
          Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file.
