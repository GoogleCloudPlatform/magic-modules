  A `KeyRing` is a toplevel logical grouping of `CryptoKeys`.


  ~> **Note:** KeyRings cannot be deleted from Google Cloud Platform.
  Destroying a Terraform-managed KeyRing will remove it from state but
  *will not delete the resource from the project.*

      # dangling resources with the auto generated tests. The hand-written
      # tests do a better job at testing that the key was removed from state
      # and that no keyrings are left behind since they create (and destroy)
      # a project just for this test, but they require org level IAM roles
      # for the test service account.
