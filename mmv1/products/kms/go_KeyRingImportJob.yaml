name: 'KeyRingImportJob'
description: |
  A `KeyRingImportJob` can be used to create `CryptoKeys` and `CryptoKeyVersions` using pre-existing
  key material, generated outside of Cloud KMS. A `KeyRingImportJob` expires 3 days after it is created.
  Once expired, Cloud KMS will no longer be able to import or unwrap any key material that
  was wrapped with the `KeyRingImportJob`'s public key.


  ~> **Note:** KeyRingImportJobs cannot be deleted from Google Cloud Platform.
  Destroying a Terraform-managed KeyRingImportJob will remove it from state but
  *will not delete the resource from the project.*
