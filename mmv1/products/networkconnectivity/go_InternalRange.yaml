  'The internal range resource for IPAM operations within a VPC network. Used to represent a private address range along with behavioral characterstics of that range (its usage and peering behavior). Networking resources can link to this range if they are created as belonging to it.'

  - name: 'prefixLength'
    type: Integer
    description: |
      An alternate to ipCidrRange. Can be set when trying to create a reservation that automatically finds a free range of the given size.
      If both ipCidrRange and prefixLength are set, there is an error if the range sizes do not match. Can also be used during updates to change the range size.
  - name: 'targetCidrRange'
    type: Array
    description: |
      Optional. Can be set to narrow down or pick a different address space while searching for a free range.
      If not set, defaults to the "10.0.0.0/8" address space. This can be used to search in other rfc-1918 address spaces like "172.16.0.0/12" and "192.168.0.0/16" or non-rfc-1918 address spaces used in the VPC.
    item_type:

    type: Array
    description: |
      Output only. The list of resources that refer to this internal range.
      Resources that use the internal range for their range allocation are referred to as users of the range.
      Other resources mark themselves as users while doing so by creating a reference to this internal range. Having a user, based on this reference, prevents deletion of the internal range referred to. Can be empty.
