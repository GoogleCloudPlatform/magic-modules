      The IP Address of the Regional Endpoint. When no address is provided, an IP from the subnetwork is allocated. Use one of the following formats: * IPv4 address as in `10.0.0.1` * Address resource URI as in `projects/{project}/regions/{region}/addresses/{address_name}`

      ~> **Note:** This field accepts both a reference to a Compute Address resource, which is the resource name of which format is given in the description, and IP literal value. If the user chooses to input a reserved address value; they need to make sure that the reserved address is in IPv4 version, its purpose is GCE_ENDPOINT, its type is INTERNAL and its status is RESERVED. If the user chooses to input an IP literal, they need to make sure that it's a valid IPv4 address (x.x.x.x) within the subnetwork.
