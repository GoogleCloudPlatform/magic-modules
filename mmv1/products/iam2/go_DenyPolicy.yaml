                The identities that are prevented from using one or more
                permissions on Google Cloud resources.

              description: |
                Specifies the permissions that this rule excludes from the set of denied permissions given by deniedPermissions.
                If a permission appears in deniedPermissions and in exceptionPermissions then it will not be denied.
                The excluded permissions can be specified using the same syntax as deniedPermissions.

                    e.g. when hovered over it in a UI.
                - name: 'location'
                  type: String
