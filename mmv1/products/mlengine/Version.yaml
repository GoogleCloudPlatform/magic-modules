      Automatically scale the number of nodes used to serve the model in
      response to increases and decreases in traffic. Care should be taken
      to ramp up traffic according to the model's ability to scale or you
      will start seeing increases in latency and 429 response codes.

      Manually select the number of nodes to use for serving the model. You
      should generally use autoScaling with an appropriate minNodes
      instead, but this option is available if you want more predictable
      billing. Beware that latency and error rates will increase if the
      traffic exceeds that capability of the system to serve it based on
      the selected number of nodes.
