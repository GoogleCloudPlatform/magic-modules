        Automatically scale the number of nodes used to serve the model in
        response to increases and decreases in traffic. Care should be taken
        to ramp up traffic according to the model's ability to scale or you
        will start seeing increases in latency and 429 response codes.

        Manually select the number of nodes to use for serving the model. You
        should generally use autoScaling with an appropriate minNodes
        instead, but this option is available if you want more predictable
        billing. Beware that latency and error rates will increase if the
        traffic exceeds that capability of the system to serve it based on
        the selected number of nodes.
