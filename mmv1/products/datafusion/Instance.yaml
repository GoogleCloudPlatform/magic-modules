      using point and click UI. However, there are certain limitations, such as fewer number
      of concurrent pipelines, no support for streaming pipelines, etc.
      - ENTERPRISE: Enterprise Data Fusion instance. In Enterprise type, the user will have more features
      available, such as support for streaming pipelines, higher number of concurrent pipelines, etc.
      - DEVELOPER: Developer Data Fusion instance. In Developer type, the user will have all features available but
      with restrictive capabilities. This is to help enterprises design and develop their data ingestion and integration
      pipelines at low cost.
