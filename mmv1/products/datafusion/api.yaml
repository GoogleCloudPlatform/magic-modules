          - BASIC: Basic Data Fusion instance. In Basic type, the user will be able to create data pipelines
          using point and click UI. However, there are certain limitations, such as fewer number
          of concurrent pipelines, no support for streaming pipelines, etc.
          - ENTERPRISE: Enterprise Data Fusion instance. In Enterprise type, the user will have more features
          available, such as support for streaming pipelines, higher number of concurrent pipelines, etc.
          - DEVELOPER: Developer Data Fusion instance. In Developer type, the user will have all features available but
          with restrictive capabilities. This is to help enterprises design and develop their data ingestion and integration 
          pipelines at low cost.
