    description: |
      Whether Terraform will be prevented from destroying the workflow. Defaults to true.
      When a`terraform destroy` or `terraform apply` would delete the workflow,
      the command will fail if this field is not set to false in Terraform state.
      When the field is set to true or unset in Terraform state, a `terraform apply`
      or `terraform destroy` that would delete the workflow will fail.
      When the field is set to false, deleting the workflow is allowed.

  - name: 'createTime'
    type: String
    description: |
      The timestamp of when the workflow was created in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits.
    output: true

  - name: 'serviceAccount'
    type: String
    description: |
      Name of the service account associated with the latest workflow version. This service
      account represents the identity of the workflow and determines what permissions the workflow has.
      Format: projects/{project}/serviceAccounts/{account} or {account}.
      Using - as a wildcard for the {project} or not providing one at all will infer the project from the account.
      The {account} value can be the email address or the unique_id of the service account.
      If not provided, workflow will use the project's default service account.
      Modifying this field for an existing workflow results in a new workflow revision.
