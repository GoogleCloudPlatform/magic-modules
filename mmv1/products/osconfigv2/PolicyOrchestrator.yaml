          OS policy assignment is an API resource that is used to
          apply a set of OS policies to a dynamically targeted group of Compute Engine
          VM instances.

          An OS policy is used to define the desired state configuration for a
          Compute Engine VM instance through a set of configuration resources that
          provide capabilities such as installing or removing software packages, or
          executing a script.

          For more information about the OS policy resource definitions and examples,
          see
          [OS policy and OS policy
          assignment](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/os-configuration-management/working-with-os-policies).

                          satisfies at least one of the following inventory filters.

                          For example, to apply this resource group to VMs running either `RHEL` or
                          `CentOS` operating systems, specify 2 items for the list with following
                          values:

                          If the list is empty, this resource group will be applied to the target
                          VM unconditionally.

                                A resource that allows executing scripts on the VM.

                                The `ExecResource` has 2 stages: `validate` and `enforce` and both stages
                                accept a script as an argument to execute.

                                When the `ExecResource` is applied by the agent, it first executes the
                                script in the `validate` stage. The `validate` stage can signal that the
                                `ExecResource` is already in the desired state by returning an exit code
                                of `100`. If the `ExecResource` is not in the desired state, it should
                                return an exit code of `101`. Any other exit code returned by this stage
                                is considered an error.

                                If the `ExecResource` is not in the desired state based on the exit code
                                from the `validate` stage, the agent proceeds to execute the script from
                                the `enforce` stage. If the `ExecResource` is already in the desired
                                state, the `enforce` stage will not be run.
                                Similar to `validate` stage, the `enforce` stage should return an exit
                                code of `100` to indicate that the resource in now in its desired state.
                                Any other exit code is considered an error.

                                NOTE: An exit code of `100` was chosen over `0` (and `101` vs `1`) to
                                have an explicit indicator of `in desired state`, `not in desired state`
                                and errors. Because, for example, Powershell will always return an exit
                                code of `0` unless an `exit` statement is provided in the script. So, for
                                reasons of consistency and being explicit, exit codes `100` and `101`
                                were chosen.
