      The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of:

      * Number of tasks in the queue
      * User-specified throttling: rateLimits, retryConfig, and the queue's state.
      * System throttling due to 429 (Too Many Requests) or 503 (Service
        Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to
        smooth sudden large traffic spikes.

          The max burst size.

          Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are
          in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high
          rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits
          resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.

          Cloud Tasks will attempt the task maxAttempts times (that is, if
          the first attempt fails, then there will be maxAttempts - 1
          retries). Must be >= -1.

          If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick
          the default.

          -1 indicates unlimited attempts.

          retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first
          attempted. Once maxRetryDuration time has passed and the task has
          been attempted maxAttempts times, no further attempts will be
          made and the task will be deleted.

          If zero, then the task age is unlimited.

          up to maxAttempts times.
