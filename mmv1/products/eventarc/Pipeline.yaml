            - name: messageBindingTemplate
              type: String
              description: |-
                The CEL expression used to modify how the destination-bound HTTP
                request is constructed.

                If a binding expression is not specified here, the message
                is treated as a CloudEvent and is mapped to the HTTP request according
                to the CloudEvent HTTP Protocol Binding Binary Content Mode
                (https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md#31-binary-content-mode).
                In this representation, all fields except the `data` and
                `datacontenttype` field on the message are mapped to HTTP request
                headers with a prefix of `ce-`.

                To construct the HTTP request payload and the value of the content-type
                HTTP header, the payload format is defined as follows:
                1) Use the output_payload_format_type on the Pipeline.Destination if it
                is set, else:
                2) Use the input_payload_format_type on the Pipeline if it is set,
                else:
                3) Treat the payload as opaque binary data.

                The `data` field of the message is converted to the payload format or
                left as-is for case 3) and then attached as the payload of the HTTP
                request. The `content-type` header on the HTTP request is set to the
                payload format type or left empty for case 3). However, if a mediation
                has updated the `datacontenttype` field on the message so that it is
                not the same as the payload format type but it is still a prefix of the
                payload format type, then the `content-type` header on the HTTP request
                is set to this `datacontenttype` value. For example, if the
                `datacontenttype` is "application/json" and the payload format type is
                "application/json; charset=utf-8", then the `content-type` header on
                the HTTP request is set to "application/json; charset=utf-8".

                If a non-empty binding expression is specified then this expression is
                used to modify the default CloudEvent HTTP Protocol Binding Binary
                Content representation.
                The result of the CEL expression must be a map of key/value pairs
                which is used as follows:
                - If a map named `headers` exists on the result of the expression,
                then its key/value pairs are directly mapped to the HTTP request
                headers. The headers values are constructed from the corresponding
                value type's canonical representation. If the `headers` field doesn't
                exist then the resulting HTTP request will be the headers of the
                CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode representation of the final
                message. Note: If the specified binding expression, has updated the
                `datacontenttype` field on the message so that it is not the same as
                the payload format type but it is still a prefix of the payload format
                type, then the `content-type` header in the `headers` map is set to
                this `datacontenttype` value.
                - If a field named `body` exists on the result of the expression then
                its value is directly mapped to the body of the request. If the value
                of the `body` field is of type bytes or string then it is used for
                the HTTP request body as-is, with no conversion. If the body field is
                of any other type then it is converted to a JSON string. If the body
                field does not exist then the resulting payload of the HTTP request
                will be data value of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode
                representation of the final message as described earlier.
                - Any other fields in the resulting expression will be ignored.

                The CEL expression may access the incoming CloudEvent message in its
                definition, as follows:
                - The `data` field of the incoming CloudEvent message can be accessed
                using the `message.data` value. Subfields of `message.data` may also be
                accessed if an input_payload_format has been specified on the Pipeline.
                - Each attribute of the incoming CloudEvent message can be accessed
                using the `message.` value, where  is replaced with the
                name of the attribute.
                - Existing headers can be accessed in the CEL expression using the
                `headers` variable. The `headers` variable defines a map of key/value
                pairs corresponding to the HTTP headers of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding
                Binary Content Mode representation of the final message as described
                earlier. For example, the following CEL expression can be used to
                construct an HTTP request by adding an additional header to the HTTP
                headers of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode
                representation of the final message and by overwriting the body of the
                request:

                ```
                {
                "headers": headers.merge({"new-header-key": "new-header-value"}),
                "body": "new-body"
                }
                ```
                - The default binding for the message payload can be accessed using the
                `body` variable. It conatins a string representation of the message
                payload in the format specified by the `output_payload_format` field.
                If the `input_payload_format` field is not set, the `body`
                variable contains the same message payload bytes that were published.

                Additionally, the following CEL extension functions are provided for
                use in this CEL expression:
                - toBase64Url:
                map.toBase64Url() -> string
                - Converts a CelValue to a base64url encoded string
                - toJsonString: map.toJsonString() -> string
                - Converts a CelValue to a JSON string
                - merge:
                map1.merge(map2) -> map3
                - Merges the passed CEL map with the existing CEL map the
                function is applied to.
                - If the same key exists in both maps, if the key's value is type
                map both maps are merged else the value from the passed map is
                used.
                - denormalize:
                map.denormalize() -> map
                - Denormalizes a CEL map such that every value of type map or key
                in the map is expanded to return a single level map.
                - The resulting keys are "." separated indices of the map keys.
                - For example:
                {
                "a": 1,
                "b": {
                "c": 2,
                "d": 3
                }
                "e": [4, 5]
                }
                .denormalize()
                -> {
                "a": 1,
                "b.c": 2,
                "b.d": 3,
                "e.0": 4,
                "e.1": 5
                }
                - setField:
                map.setField(key, value) -> message
                - Sets the field of the message with the given key to the
                given value.
                - If the field is not present it will be added.
                - If the field is present it will be overwritten.
                - The key can be a dot separated path to set a field in a nested
                message.
                - Key must be of type string.
                - Value may be any valid type.
                - removeFields:
                map.removeFields([key1, key2, ...]) -> message
                - Removes the fields of the map with the given keys.
                - The keys can be a dot separated path to remove a field in a
                nested message.
                - If a key is not found it will be ignored.
                - Keys must be of type string.
                - toMap:
                [map1, map2, ...].toMap() -> map
                - Converts a CEL list of CEL maps to a single CEL map
                - toCloudEventJsonWithPayloadFormat:
                message.toCloudEventJsonWithPayloadFormat() -> map
                - Converts a message to the corresponding structure of JSON
                format for CloudEvents.
                - It converts `data` to destination payload format
                specified in `output_payload_format`. If `output_payload_format` is
                not set, the data will remain unchanged.
                - It also sets the corresponding datacontenttype of
                the CloudEvent, as indicated by
                `output_payload_format`. If no
                `output_payload_format` is set it will use the value of the
                "datacontenttype" attribute on the CloudEvent if present, else
                remove "datacontenttype" attribute.
                - This function expects that the content of the message will
                adhere to the standard CloudEvent format. If it doesn't then this
                function will fail.
                - The result is a CEL map that corresponds to the JSON
                representation of the CloudEvent. To convert that data to a JSON
                string it can be chained with the toJsonString function.

                The Pipeline expects that the message it receives adheres to the
                standard CloudEvent format. If it doesn't then the outgoing message
                request may fail with a persistent error.
