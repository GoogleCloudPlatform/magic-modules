name: 'SecurityAction'
description: |
  A SecurityAction is rule that can be enforced at an environment level.
  The result is one of: - A denied API call - An explicitly allowed API call
  - A flagged API call (HTTP headers added before the target receives it)
  At least one condition is required to create a SecurityAction.

      If unset, this would apply to all proxies in the environment.
      If set, this action is enforced only if at least one proxy in the repeated

      There can be at most 100 enabled actions with proxies set in an env.
      Several other restrictions apply on conditions and are detailed later.
