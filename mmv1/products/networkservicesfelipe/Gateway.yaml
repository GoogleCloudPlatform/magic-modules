  Gateway represents the configuration for a proxy, typically a load balancer.
  It captures the ip:port over which the services are exposed by the proxy,
  along with any policy configurations. Routes have reference to to Gateways
  to dictate how requests should be routed by this Gateway.

      Scope determines how configuration across multiple Gateway instances are merged.
      The configuration for multiple Gateway instances with the same scope will be merged as presented as
      a single coniguration to the proxy/load balancer. 
      Max length 64 characters. Scope should start with a letter and can only have letters, numbers, hyphens.

    description: |
      One or more port numbers (1-65535), on which the Gateway will receive traffic.
      The proxy binds to the specified ports. Gateways of type 'SECURE_WEB_GATEWAY' are 
      limited to 1 port. Gateways of type 'OPEN_MESH' listen on 0.0.0.0 and support multiple ports.
