        DEPLOYING:

        UNINSTALLING:
          The Extension Instance is being removed from the project. Could resolve
          to `ERRORED`, but more likely the instance will soon cease to exist.

          The Extension Instance encountered an error while `DEPLOYING` or
          `UNINSTALLING`.

          The Extension's resources have been removed from the project, but the
          Config remains so the Instance can be restored.
