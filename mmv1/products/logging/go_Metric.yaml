name: 'Metric'
description: |
  Logs-based metric can also be used to extract values from logs and create a a distribution
  of the values. The distribution records the statistics of the extracted values along with
  an optional histogram of the values as specified by the bucket options.

      The optional metric descriptor associated with the logs-based metric.

        type: String
        description: |
          The unit in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the valueType is
          `INT64`, `DOUBLE`, or `DISTRIBUTION`. The supported units are a subset of

        type: Array
        description: |
          The set of labels that can be used to describe a specific instance of this metric type. For
          example, the appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_latencies metric type has a label
          for the HTTP response code, response_code, so you can look at latencies for successful responses
          or just for responses that failed.

        type: String
        description: |
          A concise name for the metric, which can be displayed in user interfaces. Use sentence case
          without an ending period, for example "Request count". This field is optional but it is
          recommended to be set for any metrics associated with user-visible concepts, such as Quota.
  - name: 'labelExtractors'
    type: KeyValuePairs
    description: |
      A map from a label key string to an extractor expression which is used to extract data from a log
      entry field and assign as the label value. Each label key specified in the LabelDescriptor must
      have an associated extractor expression in this map. The syntax of the extractor expression is
      the same as for the valueExtractor field.
  - name: 'valueExtractor'
    type: String
    description: |
      A valueExtractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to
      record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction - EXTRACT(field) or
      REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The argument are 1. field - The name of the log entry field from which
      the value is to be extracted. 2. regex - A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax
      (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture group to extract data from the specified
      log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an
      error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.
  - name: 'bucketOptions'
    type: NestedObject
    description: |
      The bucketOptions are required when the logs-based metric is using a DISTRIBUTION value type and it
      describes the bucket boundaries used to create a histogram of the extracted values.

        type: NestedObject
        description: |
