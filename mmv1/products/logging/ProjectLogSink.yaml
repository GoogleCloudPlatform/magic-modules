    Describes a sink used to export log entries
  properties:
    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
      name: project
      description: |
        Id of the project that this sink belongs to.
      required: true
    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
      name: name
      description: |
        Name of the log sink.
      required: true
    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
      name: filter
      description: |
        An advanced logs filter. The only exported log entries are those that are in the
        resource owning the sink and that match the filter.
    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
      name: destination
      description: |
        The export destination.
    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
      name: writerIdentity
      description: |
        An IAM identity—a service account or group—under which Logging writes the exported
        log entries to the sink's destination. This field is set by sinks.create and sinks.update
        based on the value of uniqueWriterIdentity in those methods.
    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
      name: includeChildren
      description: |
        If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are
        available for export. If the field is true, then logs from all the projects, folders, and
        billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export.
        Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.
