      The bucket for which the linked dataset will be created
properties:
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: name
    output: true
    description: |
      The resource name of the linked dataset. The name can have up to 100 characters. A valid link id
      (at the end of the link name) must only have alphanumeric characters and underscores within it. 
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: 'description'
    description: |
      Describes this link. The maximum length of the description is 8000 characters.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: createTime
    output: true
    description: |
      Output only. The creation timestamp of the link. A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format,
      with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z"
      and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Enum
    name: lifecycleState
    output: true
    description: |
      Output only. The resource lifecycle state.

  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::NestedObject
    name: bigqueryDataset 
    description: |
      The information of a BigQuery Dataset. When a link is created, a BigQuery dataset is created along
      with it, in the same project as the LogBucket it's linked to. This dataset will also have BigQuery
      Views corresponding to the LogViews in the bucket.
    properties:
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
        name: datasetId 
        output: true
        description: |
          Output only. The full resource name of the BigQuery dataset. The DATASET_ID will match the ID
          of the link, so the link must match the naming restrictions of BigQuery datasets
          (alphanumeric characters and underscores only). The dataset will have a resource path of
          "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET_ID]"
