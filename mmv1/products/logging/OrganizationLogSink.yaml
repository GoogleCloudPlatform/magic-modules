  Describes a sink used to export log entries
exclude: true
properties:
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: organization
    description: |
      Id of the organization that this sink belongs to.
    required: true
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: name
    description: |
      Name of the log sink.
    required: true
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: filter
    description: |
      An advanced logs filter. The only exported log entries are those that are in the
      resource owning the sink and that match the filter.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: destination
    description: |
      The export destination.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: writerIdentity
    description: |
      An IAM identity—a service account or group—under which Logging writes the exported
      log entries to the sink's destination. This field is set by sinks.create and sinks.update
      based on the value of uniqueWriterIdentity in those methods.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
    name: includeChildren
    description: |
      If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are
      available for export. If the field is true, then logs from all the projects, folders, and
      billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export.
      Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.
