  Manages the VPC Service Controls configuration for a service
  networking connection

  When enabled, Google Cloud makes the following
  route configuration changes in the service producer VPC network:
  - Removes the IPv4 default route (destination 0.0.0.0/0,
    next hop default internet gateway), Google Cloud then creates an
    IPv4 route for destination 199.36.153.4/30 using the default
    internet gateway next hop.
  - Creates Cloud DNS managed private zones and authorizes those zones
    for the service producer VPC network. The zones include
    googleapis.com, gcr.io, pkg.dev, notebooks.cloud.google.com,
    kernels.googleusercontent.com, backupdr.cloud.google.com, and
    backupdr.googleusercontent.com as necessary domains or host names
    for Google APIs and services that are compatible with VPC Service
    Controls. Record data in the zones resolves all host names to
    199.36.153.4, 199.36.153.5, 199.36.153.6, and 199.36.153.7.

  When disabled, Google Cloud makes the following route configuration
  changes in the service producer VPC network:
  - Restores a default route (destination 0.0.0.0/0, next hop default
    internet gateway)
  - Deletes the Cloud DNS managed private zones that provided the host
    name overrides.
