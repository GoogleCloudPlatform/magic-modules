  note: |
    Users can promote a secondary cluster to a primary cluster with the help of `cluster_type`.
    To promote, users have to set the `cluster_type` property as `PRIMARY` and remove the `secondary_config` field from cluster configuration.
    [See Example](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/pull/16413).

    Switchover is supported in terraform by refreshing the state of the terraform configurations.
    The switchover operation still needs to be called outside of terraform.
    After the switchover operation is completed successfully:
      1. Refresh the state of the AlloyDB resources by running `terraform apply -refresh-only --auto-approve` .
      2. Manually update the terraform configuration file(s) to match the actual state of the resources by modifying the `cluster_type` and `secondary_config` fields.
      3. Verify the sync of terraform state by running `terraform plan` and ensure that the infrastructure matches the configuration and no changes are required.

      Policy to determine if the cluster should be deleted forcefully.
      Deleting a cluster forcefully, deletes the cluster and all its associated instances within the cluster.
      Deleting a Secondary cluster with a secondary instance REQUIRES setting deletion_policy = "FORCE" otherwise an error is returned. This is needed as there is no support to delete just the secondary instance, and the only way to delete secondary instance is to delete the associated secondary cluster forcefully which also deletes the secondary instance.
