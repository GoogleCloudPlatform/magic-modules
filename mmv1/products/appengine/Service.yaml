  description: |
    A Service resource is a logical component of an application that can share state and communicate in a secure fashion with other services.
    For example, an application that handles customer requests might include separate services to handle tasks such as backend data analysis or API requests from mobile devices.
    Each service has a collection of versions that define a specific set of code used to implement the functionality of that service.

# StandardAppVersion and FlexibleAppVersion use the same API endpoint (apps.services.versions)
# They are split apart as some of the fields will are necessary for one and not the other, and
# other fields may have different defaults.  However, some fields are the same.  If fixing a bug
# in one, please check the other for the same fix.
