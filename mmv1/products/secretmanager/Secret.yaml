  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::KeyValueLabels
    name: labels
    description: |
      The labels assigned to this Secret.

      Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes,
      and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}][\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,62}

      Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes,
      and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63}

      No more than 64 labels can be assigned to a given resource.

      { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::KeyValueAnnotations
    name: annotations
    description: |
      Custom metadata about the secret.

      Annotations are distinct from various forms of labels. Annotations exist to allow
      client tools to store their own state information without requiring a database.

      Annotation keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of
      maximum 128 bytes, begin and end with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]), and
      may have dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics in between these
      symbols.

      The total size of annotation keys and values must be less than 16KiB.

      An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example:
      { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::KeyValuePairs
    name: versionAliases
    description: |
      Mapping from version alias to version name.

      A version alias is a string with a maximum length of 63 characters and can contain
      uppercase and lowercase letters, numerals, and the hyphen (-) and underscore ('_')
      characters. An alias string must start with a letter and cannot be the string
      'latest' or 'NEW'. No more than 50 aliases can be assigned to a given secret.

      An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example:
      { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

    name: versionDestroyTtl
    description: |
      Secret Version TTL after destruction request.
      This is a part of the delayed delete feature on Secret Version.
      For secret with versionDestroyTtl>0, version destruction doesn't happen immediately
      on calling destroy instead the version goes to a disabled state and
      the actual destruction happens after this TTL expires.
