  NetApp Volumes supports volume backups, which are copies of your volumes
  stored independently from the volume. Backups are stored in backup vaults,
  which are containers for backups. If a volume is lost or deleted, you can
  use backups to restore your data to a new volume.

  When you create the first backup of a volume, all of the volume's used
  data is sent to the backup vault. Subsequent backups of the same volume
  only include data that has changed from the previous backup. This allows
  for fast incremental-forever backups and reduces the required capacity
  inside the backup vault.

  You can create manual and scheduled backups. Manual backups can be taken
  from a volume or from an existing volume snapshot. Scheduled backups
  require a backup policy.
