 Storage pools act as containers for volumes. All volumes in a storage pool share the following information:
 * Location
 * Service level
 * Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network
 * Active Directory policy
 * LDAP use for NFS volumes, if applicable
 * Customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) policy

 The capacity of the pool can be split up and assigned to volumes within the pool. Storage pools are a billable
 component of NetApp Volumes. Billing is based on the location, service level, and capacity allocated to a pool
 independent of consumption at the volume level.

 Storage pools of service level Flex are available as zonal (single zone) or regional (two zones in same region) pools.
 Zonal and regional pools are high-available within the zone. On top of that, regional pools have `replica_zone` as
 hot standby zone. All volume access is served from the `zone`. If `zone` fails, `replica_zone`
 automatically becomes the active zone. This will cause state drift in your configuration.
 If a zone switch (manual or automatic) is triggered outside of Terraform, you need to adjust the `zone`
 and `replica_zone` values to reflect the current state, or Terraform will initiate a zone switch when running
 the next apply. You can trigger a manual
 [zone switch](https://cloud.google.com/netapp/volumes/docs/configure-and-use/storage-pools/edit-or-delete-storage-pool#switch_active_and_replica_zones)
 via Terraform by swapping the value of the `zone` and `replica_zone` parameters in your HCL code.
 Note : Regional FLEX storage pool are supported in beta provider currently.
