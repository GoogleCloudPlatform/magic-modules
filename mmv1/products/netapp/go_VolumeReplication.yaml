description: |
  Volume replication creates an asynchronous mirror of a volume in a different location. This capability
  lets you use the replicated volume for critical application activity in case of a location-wide outage
  or disaster.

  A new destination volume is created as part of the replication resource. It's content is updated on a
  schedule with content of the source volume. It can be used as a read-only copy while the mirror is
  enabled, or as an independent read-write volume while the mirror is stopped. A destination volume will
  also contain the snapshots of the source volume. Resuming a mirror will overwrite all changes on the
  destination volume with the content of the source volume. While is mirror is enabled, all configuration
  changes done to source or destination volumes are automatically done to both. Please note that the
  destination volume is not a resource managed by Terraform.

  Reversing the replication direction is not supported through the provider.

    description: |
      A destination volume is created as part of replication creation. The destination volume will not became
      under Terraform management unless you import it manually. If you delete the replication, this volume
      will remain.
      Setting this parameter to true will delete the *current* destination volume when destroying the
      replication. If you reversed the replication direction, this will be your former source volume!
      For production use, it is recommended to keep this parameter false to avoid accidental volume
      deletion. Handle with care. Default is false.
    type: Boolean
    default_value: false
  - name: 'replication_enabled'
    description: |
      Set to false to stop/break the mirror. Stopping the mirror makes the destination volume read-write
      and act independently from the source volume.
      Set to true to enable/resume the mirror. WARNING: Resuming a mirror overwrites any changes
      done to the destination volume with the content of the source volume.
    type: Boolean
    default_value: true
  - name: 'force_stopping'
    description: |
      Only replications with mirror_state=MIRRORED can be stopped. A replication in mirror_state=TRANSFERRING
      currently receives an update and stopping the update might be undesirable. Set this parameter to true
      to stop anyway. All data transferred to the destination will be discarded and content of destination
      volume will remain at the state of the last successful update. Default is false.
    type: Boolean
    default_value: false
  - name: 'wait_for_mirror'
    description: |
      Replication resource state is independent of mirror_state. With enough data, it can take many hours
      for mirror_state to reach MIRRORED. If you want Terraform to wait for the mirror to finish on
      create/stop/resume operations, set this parameter to true. Default is false.
