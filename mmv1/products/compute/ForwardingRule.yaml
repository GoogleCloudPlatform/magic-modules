      An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
      reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
      reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.

      The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy

      This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can be

      and HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network TCP/UDP load balancers.
      INTERNAL is used for protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP address,

      EXTERNAL_MANAGED is used for regional external HTTP(S) load balancers.
      INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for internal HTTP(S) load balancers.

      Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
      disjoint port ranges.

      ports:

      Only packets addressed to these ports will be forwarded to the backends
