  # This is a multi-resource resource reference (Address, GlobalAddress)
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: 'IPAddress'
    description: |
      The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
      traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
      the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
      loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
      type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
      to [IP address specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).

      An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
      reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
      reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.

      The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
      that has validateForProxyless field set to true.

      For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
      Google APIs, IP address must be provided.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Enum

      This signifies what the ForwardingRule will be used for and can be
      EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED, INTERNAL, or INTERNAL_MANAGED. EXTERNAL is used for Classic
      Cloud VPN gateways, protocol forwarding to VMs from an external IP address,
      and HTTP(S), SSL Proxy, TCP Proxy, and Network TCP/UDP load balancers.
      INTERNAL is used for protocol forwarding to VMs from an internal IP address,
      and internal TCP/UDP load balancers.
      EXTERNAL_MANAGED is used for regional external HTTP(S) load balancers.
      INTERNAL_MANAGED is used for internal HTTP(S) load balancers.

      ([Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) only) Note: This field must be set to ""
      if the target is an URI of a service attachment.

      - :INTERNAL_MANAGED
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: 'name'
    description: |
      Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.

      For internal load balancing, this field identifies the network that
      the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If
      this field is not specified, the default network will be used.
      This field is only used for INTERNAL load balancing.
  # TODO(nelsonjr): When implementing new types enable converting the
  # manifest input from a single value to a range of form NN-NN. The API
  # accepts a single value, e.g. '80', but the API stores and returns
  # '80-80'. This causes idempotency false positive.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: 'portRange'
    description: |
      This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
      TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
      TargetPool, TargetInstance.

      Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
      addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
      Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
      disjoint port ranges.

      Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
      ports:

      * TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080
      * TargetHttpsProxy: 443
      * TargetTcpProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
                        1883, 5222
      * TargetSslProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995,
                        1883, 5222
      * TargetVpnGateway: 500, 4500
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Array
    name: 'ports'
    max_size: 5
    description: |
      This field is used along with internal load balancing and network
      load balancer when the forwarding rule references a backend service
      and when protocol is not L3_DEFAULT.

      A single port or a comma separated list of ports can be configured.
      Only packets addressed to these ports will be forwarded to the backends
      configured with this forwarding rule.

      You can only use one of ports and portRange, or allPorts.
      The three are mutually exclusive.

      You may specify a maximum of up to 5 ports, which can be non-contiguous.

      If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is
      optional. However, if the network is in custom subnet mode, a
      subnetwork must be specified.

    description: |
      This field can be used with internal load balancer or network load balancer
      when the forwarding rule references a backend service, or with the target
      field when it references a TargetInstance. Set this to true to
      allow packets addressed to any ports to be forwarded to the backends configured
      with this forwarding rule. This can be used when the protocol is TCP/UDP, and it
      must be set to true when the protocol is set to L3_DEFAULT.
      Cannot be set if port or portRange are set.
