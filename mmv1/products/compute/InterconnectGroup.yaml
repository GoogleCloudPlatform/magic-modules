      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be

      long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash,
      lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

      Interconnects in the InterconnectGroup. Keys are arbitrary user-specified
      strings. Users are encouraged, but not required, to use their preferred
      format for resource links as keys.
      Note that there are add-members and remove-members methods in gcloud.
      The size of this map is limited by an "Interconnects per group" quota.
