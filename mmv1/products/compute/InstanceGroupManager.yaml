  Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in
  the request. After the group is created, it schedules an action to create
  instances in the group using the specified instance template. This
  operation is marked as DONE when the group is created even if the
  instances in the group have not yet been created. You must separately
  verify the status of the individual instances.

  A managed instance group can have up to 1000 VM instances per group.

    description: |
      The base instance name to use for instances in this group. The value
      must be 1-58 characters long. Instances are named by appending a
      hyphen and a random four-character string to the base instance name.
      The base instance name must comply with RFC1035.

        description: |
          The total number of instances in the managed instance group that

        description: |
          The number of instances in the managed instance group that are
          scheduled to be created or are currently being created. If the
          group fails to create any of these instances, it tries again until
          it creates the instance successfully.

          If you have disabled creation retries, this field will not be
          populated; instead, the creatingWithoutRetries field will be
          populated.

          The number of instances in the managed instance group that are
          scheduled to be recreated or are currently being being recreated.
          Recreating an instance deletes the existing root persistent disk
          and creates a new disk from the image that is defined in the
          instance template.
