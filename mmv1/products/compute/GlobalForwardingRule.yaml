    Represents a GlobalForwardingRule resource. Global forwarding rules are
    used to forward traffic to the correct load balancer for HTTP load
    balancing. Global forwarding rules can only be used for HTTP load
    balancing.

      description: |
        The IP address that this forwarding rule serves. When a client sends
        traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic to
        the target that you specify in the forwarding rule. The
        loadBalancingScheme and the forwarding rule's target determine the
        type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, refer
        to [IP address specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).

        An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a
        reference to an existing Address resource. If you don't specify a
        reserved IP address, an ephemeral IP address is assigned.

        The value must be set to 0.0.0.0 when the target is a targetGrpcProxy
        that has validateForProxyless field set to true.

        For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to
        Google APIs, IP address must be provided.

        External TCP/UDP LB, SSL Proxy). The value of EXTERNAL_MANAGED means

        Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing
        configuration to a limited set xDS compliant clients. In their xDS
        requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present node metadata. If a
        match takes place, the relevant routing configuration is made available
        to those proxies.

        For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set
        to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the
        corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria
        is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with
        corresponding labels in the provided metadata.

        metadataFilters specified here can be overridden by those specified in
        the UrlMap that this ForwardingRule references.

        metadataFilters only applies to Loadbalancers that have their
        loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.

        This field is not used for external load balancing.

        identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to
        for this global forwarding rule. If this field is not specified,
        the default network will be used.
    # TODO(nelsonjr): When implementing new types enable converting the
    # manifest input from a single value to a range of form NN-NN. The API
    # accepts a single value, e.g. '80', but the API stores and returns

        This field is used along with the target field for TargetHttpProxy,
        TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway,
        TargetPool, TargetInstance.

        Applicable only when IPProtocol is TCP, UDP, or SCTP, only packets
        addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target.
        Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have
        disjoint port ranges.

        Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable
        ports:

        * TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080
        * TargetHttpsProxy: 443

        For INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED load balancing, only HTTP and HTTPS targets
        are valid.

        ([Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) only) For global address with a purpose of PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT and
