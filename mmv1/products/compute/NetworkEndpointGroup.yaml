  description: |
    Network endpoint groups (NEGs) are zonal resources that represent
    collections of IP address and port combinations for GCP resources within a
    single subnet. Each IP address and port combination is called a network
    endpoint.

    Network endpoint groups can be used as backends in backend services for
    HTTP(S), TCP proxy, and SSL proxy load balancers. You cannot use NEGs as a
    backend with internal load balancers. Because NEG backends allow you to
    specify IP addresses and ports, you can distribute traffic in a granular
    fashion among applications or containers running within VM instances.

    Recreating a network endpoint group that's in use by another resource will give a
    `resourceInUseByAnotherResource` error. Use `lifecycle.create_before_destroy`
    to avoid this type of error.

        Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
        created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
        RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
        the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
        first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
        characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
        character, which cannot be a dash.

        Type of network endpoints in this network endpoint group.
        NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT is used for hybrid connectivity network
        endpoint groups (see https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/hybrid).
        Note that NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT can only be used with Backend Services
        that 1) have the following load balancing schemes: EXTERNAL, EXTERNAL_MANAGED,
        INTERNAL_MANAGED, and INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED and 2) support the RATE or
        CONNECTION balancing modes.

        Possible values include: GCE_VM_IP, GCE_VM_IP_PORT, and NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT.
      values:
        - :GCE_VM_IP
        - :GCE_VM_IP_PORT
        - :NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT
