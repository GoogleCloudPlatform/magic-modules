# Resource description for the provider documentation.
description: |
  The Health Aggregation Policy specifies how to aggregate the service's constituent source health status to determine an aggregated health status result for the service.  For example, you can specify a criteria such as “Consider the Health Source as `Healthy` if there are at least 5 healthy backend endpoints”. Or, you can specify a criteria like “Consider the Health Source as `Healthy` if minimum 60% of endpoints in the Backend are healthy”. The Health Aggregation Policy is applied to each Health Source (e.g. Backend Service) individually.

parameters:
  - name: 'region'
    type: String
    required: true
    immutable: true
    url_param_only: true
    description: |
      URL of the region where the health aggregation policy resides.
  - name: 'name'
    type: String
    required: true
    immutable: true
    description: |
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created.
      The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.

properties:
  - name: 'description'
    type: String
    description: |
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you
      create the resource.
  - name: 'policyType'
    type: Enum
    description: |
      Specifies the type of the healthAggregationPolicy. The only allowed value
      for global resources is `DNS_PUBLIC_IP_POLICY`. The only allowed
      value for regional resources is `BACKEND_SERVICE_POLICY`. Must
      be specified when the healthAggregationPolicy is created, and cannot be
      mutated.
    enum_values:
      - 'DNS_PUBLIC_IP_POLICY'
      - 'BACKEND_SERVICE_POLICY'
    default_value: 'BACKEND_SERVICE_POLICY'
  - name: 'healthyPercentThreshold'
    type: Integer
    description: |
      Can only be set if the `policyType` field is
      `BACKEND_SERVICE_POLICY`. Specifies the threshold (as a
      percentage) of healthy endpoints required in order to consider the
      aggregated health result HEALTHY. Defaults to `60`. Must be in
      range [0, 100]. Not applicable if the `policyType` field is
      `DNB_PUBLIC_IP_POLICY`. Can be mutated. This field is optional,
      and will be set to the default if unspecified. Note that both this
      threshold and `minHealthyThreshold` must be satisfied in order
      for HEALTHY to be the aggregated result. "Endpoints" refers to network
      endpoints within a Network Endpoint Group or instances within an Instance
      Group.
    default_value: 60
  - name: 'minHealthyThreshold'
    type: Integer
    description: |
      Can only be set if the `policyType` field is
      `BACKEND_SERVICE_POLICY`. Specifies the minimum number of
      healthy endpoints required in order to consider the aggregated health
      result HEALTHY. Defaults to `1`. Must be positive. Not
      applicable if the `policyType` field is
      `DNB_PUBLIC_IP_POLICY`. Can be mutated. This field is optional,
      and will be set to the default if unspecified. Note that both this
      threshold and `healthyPercentThreshold` must be satisfied in
      order for HEALTHY to be the aggregated result. "Endpoints" refers to
      network endpoints within a Network Endpoint Group or instances within an
      Instance Group.
    default_value: 1
  - name: 'id'
    type: String
    description: 'The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.'
    output: true
  - name: 'creationTimestamp'
    type: String
    description: 'Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.'
    output: true
  - name: 'selfLinkWithId'
    type: String
    description: 'Server-defined URL with id for the resource.'
    output: true
  - name: 'fingerprint'
    type: Fingerprint
    description: |
      Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object.
      This field is used in optimistic locking. This field will be ignored when
      inserting a `HealthAggregationPolicy`. An up-to-date fingerprint
      must be provided in order to patch the RegionHealthAggregationPolicy; Otherwise,
      the request will fail with error `412 conditionNotMet`. To see
      the latest fingerprint, make a `get()` request to retrieve the
      RegionHealthAggregationPolicy.
    output: true
