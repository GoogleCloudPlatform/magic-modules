      This field is applicable only when the containing target pool is
      serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool, and its failoverRatio
      field is properly set to a value between [0, 1].

      backupPool and failoverRatio together define the fallback behavior of
      the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy instances in the
      primary pool is at or below failoverRatio, traffic arriving at the
      load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.

      In case where failoverRatio and backupPool are not set, or all the
      instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be
      directed back to the primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic
      will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to
      all instances when no instance is healthy.

      This field is applicable only when the containing target pool is
      serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool (i.e., not as a backup
      pool to some other target pool). The value of the field must be in
      [0, 1].

      If set, backupPool must also be set. They together define the fallback
      behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy
      instances in the primary pool is at or below this number, traffic
      arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.

      In case where failoverRatio is not set or all the instances in the
      backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the
      primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the
      healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no
      instance is healthy.

      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is

      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
