        This field is applicable only when the containing target pool is
        serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool, and its failoverRatio
        field is properly set to a value between [0, 1].

        backupPool and failoverRatio together define the fallback behavior of
        the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy instances in the
        primary pool is at or below failoverRatio, traffic arriving at the
        load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.

        In case where failoverRatio and backupPool are not set, or all the
        instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be
        directed back to the primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic
        will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to
        all instances when no instance is healthy.

        This field is applicable only when the containing target pool is
        serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool (i.e., not as a backup
        pool to some other target pool). The value of the field must be in
        [0, 1].

        If set, backupPool must also be set. They together define the fallback
        behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy
        instances in the primary pool is at or below this number, traffic
        arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.

        In case where failoverRatio is not set or all the instances in the
        backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the
        primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the
        healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no
        instance is healthy.

        A member instance in this pool is considered healthy if and only if

        will be considered healthy at all times.

        the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
        first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
