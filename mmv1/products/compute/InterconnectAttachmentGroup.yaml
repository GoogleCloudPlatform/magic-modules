      lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

      Attachments in the AttachmentGroup. Keys are arbitrary user-specified
      strings. Users are encouraged, but not required, to use their preferred
      format for resource links as keys.
      Note that there are add-members and remove-members methods in gcloud.
      The size of this map is limited by an "Attachments per group" quota.
