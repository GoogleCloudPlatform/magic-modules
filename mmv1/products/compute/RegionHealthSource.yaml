parameters:
  - name: 'region'
    type: String
    required: true
    immutable: true
    url_param_only: true
    description: |
      URL of the region where the health source resides.
  - name: 'name'
    type: String
    required: true
    immutable: true
    description: |
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created.
      The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.

properties:
  - name: 'description'
    type: String
    description: |
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you
      create the resource.
  - name: 'sourceType'
    type: Enum
    description: |
      Specifies the type of the `HealthSource`. The only allowed value
      is `BACKEND_SERVICE`. Must be specified when the
      `HealthSource` is created, and cannot be mutated.
    enum_values:
      - 'BACKEND_SERVICE'
    required: true
    immutable: true
  - name: 'sources'
    type: Array
    item_type:
      name: 'source'
      type: ResourceRef
      resource: 'RegionBackendService'
      imports: 'selfLink'
    description: |
      URLs to the source resources. Must be size 1. Must be a
      `BackendService` if the `sourceType` is `BACKEND_SERVICE`. The
      `BackendService` must have load balancing scheme
      `INTERNAL` or `INTERNAL_MANAGED` and must be regional
      and in the same region as the `HealthSource` (cross-region
      deployment for `INTERNAL_MANAGED` is not supported). The
      `BackendService` may use only IGs, MIGs, or NEGs of type
      `GCE_VM_IP` or `GCE_VM_IP_PORT`. The
      `BackendService` may not use `haPolicy`. Can be
      mutated.
