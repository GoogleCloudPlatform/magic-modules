          min_version: beta
          description: |
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an error.

            This policy takes effect at the PathMatcher level and applies only when no policy has been defined for the error code at lower levels like RouteRule and PathRule within this PathMatcher. If an error code does not have a policy defined in defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, then a policy defined for the error code in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect.

            For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration:

            UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is configured with policies for 5xx and 4xx errors
            A RouteRule for /coming_soon/ is configured for the error code 404.
            If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com and a 404 is encountered, the policy under UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404 response is encountered for the request www.example.com/current_events/, the pathMatcher's policy takes effect. If however, the request for www.example.com/coming_soon/ encounters a 404, the policy in RouteRule.customErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If any of the requests in this example encounter a 500 error code, the policy at UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect.

            When used in conjunction with pathMatcher.defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service is returned to the client.

            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for global external Application Load Balancers.

              description: |
                Specifies rules for returning error responses.
                In a given policy, if you specify rules for both a range of error codes as well as rules for specific error codes then rules with specific error codes have a higher priority.
                For example, assume that you configure a rule for 401 (Un-authorized) code, and another for all 4 series error codes (4XX).
                If the backend service returns a 401, then the rule for 401 will be applied. However if the backend service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes effect.

                      - 5xx: Load Balancer will apply the policy if the backend service responds with any response code in the range of 500 to 599.

                  customErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an error.
                  If a policy for an error code is not configured for the PathRule, a policy for the error code configured in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. If one is not specified in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, the policy configured in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect.
                  For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration:
                  UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy are configured with policies for 5xx and 4xx errors
                  A PathRule for /coming_soon/ is configured for the error code 404.
                  If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com and a 404 is encountered, the policy under UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404 response is encountered for the request www.example.com/current_events/, the pathMatcher's policy takes effect. If however, the request for www.example.com/coming_soon/ encounters a 404, the policy in PathRule.customErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If any of the requests in this example encounter a 500 error code, the policy at UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect.
                  customErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for global external Application Load Balancers.

                      In a given policy, if you specify rules for both a range of error codes as well as rules for specific error codes then rules with specific error codes have a higher priority.
                      For example, assume that you configure a rule for 401 (Un-authorized) code, and another for all 4 series error codes (4XX).
                      If the backend service returns a 401, then the rule for 401 will be applied. However if the backend service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes effect.

If UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy contains one or more errorResponseRules[], it must specify errorService.

                          any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
                          example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
                          streams.
                          * gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
                          502, 503 or 504.
                          * connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
                          connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                          * retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                          Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                          * refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                          REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                          * cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                          header is set to cancelled
                          * deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
                          gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                          * resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                          header is set to resource-exhausted
                          * unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if

                  For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
                  in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                  in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                  a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
                  that matches the request is applied.

                  You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                  Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
                  2147483647 inclusive.

                  Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                  in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                  you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
                  future without any impact on existing rules.

                          * 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
                            any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
                            example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
                            streams.

                            502, 503 or 504.
                          * connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
                            connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                          * retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                            Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                          * refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                            REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                          * cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                            header is set to cancelled
                          * deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
                            gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                          * resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                            header is set to resource-exhausted
                          * unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in

                    * connection failure, and refused streams.
                    * gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504.
                    * connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures connecting to backend services,
                      for example due to connection timeouts.
                    * retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.

                      This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                    * cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to cancelled

    min_version: beta
    description: |
      defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an error.

      This policy takes effect at the PathMatcher level and applies only when no policy has been defined for the error code at lower levels like RouteRule and PathRule within this PathMatcher. If an error code does not have a policy defined in defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, then a policy defined for the error code in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect.

      For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration:

      UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is configured with policies for 5xx and 4xx errors
      A RouteRule for /coming_soon/ is configured for the error code 404.
      If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com and a 404 is encountered, the policy under UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404 response is encountered for the request www.example.com/current_events/, the pathMatcher's policy takes effect. If however, the request for www.example.com/coming_soon/ encounters a 404, the policy in RouteRule.customErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If any of the requests in this example encounter a 500 error code, the policy at UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect.

      When used in conjunction with pathMatcher.defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service is returned to the client.

      defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for global external Application Load Balancers.

          Specifies rules for returning error responses.
          In a given policy, if you specify rules for both a range of error codes as well as rules for specific error codes then rules with specific error codes have a higher priority.
          For example, assume that you configure a rule for 401 (Un-authorized) code, and another for all 4 series error codes (4XX).
          If the backend service returns a 401, then the rule for 401 will be applied. However if the backend service returns a 403, the rule for 4xx takes effect.
