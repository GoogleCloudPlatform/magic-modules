description: |
  An HttpHealthCheck resource. This resource defines a template for how
  individual VMs should be checked for health, via HTTP.

  ~> **Note:** google_compute_http_health_check is a legacy health check.
  The newer [google_compute_health_check](/docs/providers/google/r/compute_health_check.html)
  should be preferred for all uses except
  [Network Load Balancers](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/)
  which still require the legacy version.

      health check is performed will be used.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: 'name'
    description: |
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
