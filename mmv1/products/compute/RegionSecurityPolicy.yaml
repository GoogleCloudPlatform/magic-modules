      The type indicates the intended use of the security policy.
      - CLOUD_ARMOR: Cloud Armor backend security policies can be configured to filter incoming HTTP requests targeting backend services. They filter requests before they hit the origin servers.
      - CLOUD_ARMOR_EDGE: Cloud Armor edge security policies can be configured to filter incoming HTTP requests targeting backend services (including Cloud CDN-enabled) as well as backend buckets (Cloud Storage). They filter requests before the request is served from Google's cache.
      - CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK: Cloud Armor network policies can be configured to filter packets targeting network load balancing resources such as backend services, target pools, target instances, and instances with external IPs. They filter requests before the request is served from the application.
      This field can be set only at resource creation time.

            * redirect: redirect to a different target. This can either be an internal reCAPTCHA redirect, or an external URL-based redirect via a 302 response. Parameters for this action can be configured via redirectOptions. This action is only supported in Global Security Policies of type CLOUD_ARMOR.

            * throttle: limit client traffic to the configured threshold. Configure parameters for this action in rateLimitOptions. Requires rateLimitOptions to be set for this.

            A match condition that incoming packets are evaluated against for CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK security policies. If it matches, the corresponding 'action' is enforced.
            The match criteria for a rule consists of built-in match fields (like 'srcIpRanges') and potentially multiple user-defined match fields ('userDefinedFields').
            Field values may be extracted directly from the packet or derived from it (e.g. 'srcRegionCodes'). Some fields may not be present in every packet (e.g. 'srcPorts'). A user-defined field is only present if the base header is found in the packet and the entire field is in bounds.
            Each match field may specify which values can match it, listing one or more ranges, prefixes, or exact values that are considered a match for the field. A field value must be present in order to match a specified match field. If no match values are specified for a match field, then any field value is considered to match it, and it's not required to be present. For strings specifying '*' is also equivalent to match all.
            For a packet to match a rule, all specified match fields must match the corresponding field values derived from the packet.
            Example:
            networkMatch: srcIpRanges: - "192.0.2.0/24" - "198.51.100.0/24" userDefinedFields: - name: "ipv4_fragment_offset" values: - "1-0x1fff"
            The above match condition matches packets with a source IP in 192.0.2.0/24 or 198.51.100.0/24 and a user-defined field named "ipv4_fragment_offset" with a value between 1 and 0x1fff inclusive
