  Represents a Regional Managed Instance Group Resize Request

  Resize Requests are the Managed Instance Group implementation of Dynamic Workload Scheduler Flex Start.

  With Dynamic Workload Scheduler in Flex Start mode, you submit a GPU capacity request for your AI/ML jobs by indicating how many you need, a duration, and your preferred region. Dynamic Workload Scheduler intelligently persists the request; once the capacity becomes available, it automatically provisions your VMs enabling your workloads to run continuously for the entire duration of the capacity allocation.
