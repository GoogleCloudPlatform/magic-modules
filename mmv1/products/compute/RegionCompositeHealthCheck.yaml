parameters:
  - name: 'region'
    type: String
    required: true
    immutable: true
    url_param_only: true
    description: |
      URL of the region where the composite health check resides.
  - name: 'name'
    type: String
    required: true
    immutable: true
    description: |
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created.
      The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.

properties:
  - name: 'description'
    type: String
    description: |
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you
      create the resource.
  - name: 'healthSources'
    type: Array
    item_type:
      name: 'healthSource'
      type: ResourceRef
      resource: 'RegionHealthSource'
      imports: 'selfLink'
    description: |
      URLs to the HealthSource resources whose results are AND'ed.
      I.e. he aggregated result is is HEALTHY only if all sources
      are HEALTHY. Must have at least 1. Must not have more than 10.
      Must be regional and in the same region as the
      CompositeHealthCheck. Can be mutated.

    max_size: 10
  - name: 'healthDestination'
    type: ResourceRef
    resource: 'ForwardingRule'
    imports: 'selfLink'
    description: |
      URL to the destination resource. Must be set. Must be a
      ForwardingRule. The ForwardingRule must have
      load balancing scheme INTERNAL or
      INTERNAL_MANAGED and must be regional and in the same region
      as the CompositeHealthCheck (cross-region deployment for
      INTERNAL_MANAGED is not supported). Can be mutated.
    required: true

    type: String
    description: 'The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server.'
    output: true

    description: 'Server-defined URL with id for the resource.'
    output: true
  - name: 'fingerprint'
    type: Fingerprint
    description: |
      Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object.
      This field is used in optimistic locking. This field will be ignored when
      inserting a `CompositeHealthCheck`. An up-to-date fingerprint
      must be provided in order to patch the CompositeHealthCheck; Otherwise,
      the request will fail with error `412 conditionNotMet`. To see
      the latest fingerprint, make a `get()` request to retrieve the
      CompositeHealthCheck.
    output: true
