  Represents a GlobalForwardingRule resource. Global forwarding rules are
  used to forward traffic to the correct load balancer for HTTP load
  balancing. Global forwarding rules can only be used for HTTP load
  balancing.

  # This is a multi-resource resource reference (Address, GlobalAddress)
  - name: 'IPAddress'
    type: String
    description: |
      IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client
      sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic
      to the referenced `target`.

      While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an `IPAddress` is
      required under the following circumstances:

      * When the `target` is set to `targetGrpcProxy` and
      `validateForProxyless` is set to `true`, the
      `IPAddress` should be set to `0.0.0.0`.
      * When the `target` is a Private Service Connect Google APIs
      bundle, you must specify an `IPAddress`.

      Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an
      existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud
      assigns an ephemeral IP address.

      Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a
      forwarding rule:

      * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3`
      * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96`
      * Full resource URL, as in
      `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name`
      * Partial URL or by name, as in:
        * `projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name`
        * `regions/region/addresses/address-name`
        * `global/addresses/address-name`
        * `address-name`

      The forwarding rule's `target`,
      and in most cases, also the `loadBalancingScheme`, determine the
      type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see
      [IP address
      specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).

      When reading an `IPAddress`, the API always returns the IP
      address number.

      For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set

      is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with
      corresponding labels in the provided metadata.

      metadataFilters specified here can be overridden by those specified in

      The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      [RFC1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt).

      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.

      For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
      APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a 1-20 characters string with
      lowercase letters and numbers and must start with a letter.

      If the subnetwork is specified, the network of the subnetwork will be used.
      If neither subnetwork nor this field is specified, the default network will
      be used.

      For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
      APIs, a network must be provided.

      The `portRange` field has the following limitations:
      * It requires that the forwarding rule `IPProtocol` be TCP, UDP, or SCTP,
      and
      * It's applicable only to the following products: external passthrough
      Network Load Balancers, internal and external proxy Network Load
      Balancers, internal and external Application Load Balancers, external
      protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN.
      * Some products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See
      [port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications)
      for details.

      For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the
      same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair, and cannot have overlapping
      `portRange`s.

      For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more
      forwarding rules cannot use the same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair, and
      cannot have overlapping `portRange`s.
