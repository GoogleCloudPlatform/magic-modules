  Represents an Address resource.

  Each virtual machine instance has an ephemeral internal IP address and,
  optionally, an external IP address. To communicate between instances on
  the same network, you can use an instance's internal IP address. To
  communicate with the Internet and instances outside of the same network,
  you must specify the instance's external IP address.

  Internal IP addresses are ephemeral and only belong to an instance for
  the lifetime of the instance; if the instance is deleted and recreated,
  the instance is assigned a new internal IP address, either by Compute
  Engine or by you. External IP addresses can be either ephemeral or
  static.

properties:
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: 'address'
    description: |
      The static external IP address represented by this resource. Only
      IPv4 is supported. An address may only be specified for INTERNAL
      address types. The IP address must be inside the specified subnetwork,
      if any. Set by the API if undefined.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Enum
    name: 'addressType'
    description: |
      The type of address to reserve.
    values:
      - :INTERNAL
      - :EXTERNAL
    default_value: :EXTERNAL

    name: 'id'
    description: 'The unique identifier for the resource.'
    output: true
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: 'name'
    description: |
      Name of the resource. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and
      comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters
      long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
      which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all
      following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
      except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
    required: true
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: purpose
    description: |
      The purpose of this resource, which can be one of the following values:

      * GCE_ENDPOINT for addresses that are used by VM instances, alias IP
        ranges, internal load balancers, and similar resources.

      * SHARED_LOADBALANCER_VIP for an address that can be used by multiple
        internal load balancers.

      * VPC_PEERING for addresses that are reserved for VPC peer networks.

      * IPSEC_INTERCONNECT for addresses created from a private IP range
        that are reserved for a VLAN attachment in an IPsec-encrypted Cloud
        Interconnect configuration. These addresses are regional resources.

      * PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT for a private network address that is used
      to configure Private Service Connect. Only global internal addresses
      can use this purpose.

      This should only be set when using an Internal address.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Enum
