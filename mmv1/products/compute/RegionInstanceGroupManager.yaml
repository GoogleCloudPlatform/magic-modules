  Creates a managed instance group using the information that you specify in
  the request. After the group is created, it schedules an action to create
  instances in the group using the specified instance template. This
  operation is marked as DONE when the group is created even if the
  instances in the group have not yet been created. You must separately
  verify the status of the individual instances.

  A managed instance group can have up to 1000 VM instances per group.

      The base instance name to use for instances in this group. The value

          it creates the instance successfully.

          If you have disabled creation retries, this field will not be
