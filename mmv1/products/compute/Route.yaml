  Represents a Route resource.

  A route is a rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by
  the virtual network. Routes are associated with virtual machines by tag,
  and the set of routes for a particular virtual machine is called its
  routing table. For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system
  searches that virtual machine's routing table for a single best matching
  route.

  Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more
  specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects
  the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it
  uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the
  remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by
  the next_hop field of the winning route -- either to another virtual
  machine destination, a virtual machine gateway or a Compute
  Engine-operated gateway. Packets that do not match any route in the
  sending virtual machine's routing table will be dropped.

  A Route resource must have exactly one specification of either
  nextHopGateway, nextHopInstance, nextHopIp, nextHopVpnTunnel, or
  nextHopIlb.

    description: |
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property
      when you create the resource.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: 'name'
    description: |
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035.  Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and
      match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means
      the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the
      last character, which cannot be a dash.

      The priority of this route. Priority is used to break ties in cases
      where there is more than one matching route of equal prefix length.

      In the case of two routes with equal prefix length, the one with the
      lowest-numbered priority value wins.

      Default value is 1000. Valid range is 0 through 65535.

      URL to a gateway that should handle matching packets.

      Currently, you can only specify the internet gateway, using a full or
      partial valid URL:

      * https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/
      global/gateways/default-internet-gateway
      * projects/project/global/gateways/default-internet-gateway

    description: |
      URL to an instance that should handle matching packets.
      You can specify this as a full or partial URL. For example:

      * https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/
      instances/instance
      * projects/project/zones/zone/instances/instance
      * zones/zone/instances/instance

      URL to a Network that should handle matching packets.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: 'nextHopIlb'
    description: |
      The IP address or URL to a forwarding rule of type
      loadBalancingScheme=INTERNAL that should handle matching
      packets.

      With the GA provider you can only specify the forwarding
      rule as a partial or full URL. For example, the following
      are all valid values:
      * 10.128.0.56
      * https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/regions/region/forwardingRules/forwardingRule
      * regions/region/forwardingRules/forwardingRule

      When the beta provider, you can also specify the IP address
      of a forwarding rule from the same VPC or any peered VPC.

      Note that this can only be used when the destinationRange is
      a public (non-RFC 1918) IP CIDR range.
