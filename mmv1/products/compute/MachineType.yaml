          The deprecation state of this resource. This can be DEPRECATED,
          OBSOLETE, or DELETED. Operations which create a new resource
          using a DEPRECATED resource will return successfully, but with a
          warning indicating the deprecated resource and recommending its
          replacement. Operations which use OBSOLETE or DELETED resources
          will be rejected and result in an error.
