                  For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
                  in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                  in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                  a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
                  that matches the request is applied.

                  You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                  Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
                  2147483647 inclusive.

                  Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                  in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                  you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the

                            any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
                            example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
                            streams.

                          * connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
                            connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                          * retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                            Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                          * refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                            REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                          * cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                            header is set to cancelled
                          * deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
                            gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                          * resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                            header is set to resource-exhausted
                          * unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in

                          - 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
                          any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
                          example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
                          streams.

                          - connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
                          connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                          - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                          Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                          - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                          REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                          - cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                          header is set to cancelled
                          - deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
                          gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                          - resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                          header is set to resource-exhausted
                          - unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if

      defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the hostRules match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set. Conversely if defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
      Only one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set.
      URL maps for Classic external HTTP(S) load balancers only support the urlRewrite action within defaultRouteAction.
      defaultRouteAction has no effect when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set to true.

        description: |
          The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the resiliency of clients to backend service failure.
          As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by a load balancer on a percentage of requests before sending those requests to the backend service.
          Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the load balancer for a percentage of requests.
          timeout and retryPolicy is ignored by clients that are configured with a faultInjectionPolicy if: 1. The traffic is generated by fault injection AND 2. The fault injection is not a delay fault injection.
          Fault injection is not supported with the global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic). To see which load balancers support fault injection, see Load balancing: [Routing and traffic management features](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#routing-traffic-management).
