  # This is a multi-resource resource reference (Address, GlobalAddress)
  - name: 'IPAddress'
    type: String
    description: |
      IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a client
      sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs the traffic
      to the referenced `target` or `backendService`.

      While creating a forwarding rule, specifying an `IPAddress` is
      required under the following circumstances:

      * When the `target` is set to `targetGrpcProxy` and
      `validateForProxyless` is set to `true`, the
      `IPAddress` should be set to `0.0.0.0`.
      * When the `target` is a Private Service Connect Google APIs
      bundle, you must specify an `IPAddress`.

      Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references an
      existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud
      assigns an ephemeral IP address.

      Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while creating a
      forwarding rule:

      * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3`
      * IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96`
      * Full resource URL, as in
      `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name`
      * Partial URL or by name, as in:
        * `projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name`
        * `regions/region/addresses/address-name`
        * `global/addresses/address-name`
        * `address-name`

      The forwarding rule's `target` or `backendService`,
      and in most cases, also the `loadBalancingScheme`, determine the
      type of IP address that you can use. For detailed information, see
      [IP address
      specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).

      When reading an `IPAddress`, the API always returns the IP
      address number.

      The IP protocol to which this rule applies.

      For protocol forwarding, valid
      options are `TCP`, `UDP`, `ESP`,
      `AH`, `SCTP`, `ICMP` and
      `L3_DEFAULT`.

      The valid IP protocols are different for different load balancing products
      as described in [Load balancing
      features](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#protocols_from_the_load_balancer_to_the_backends).

      A Forwarding Rule with protocol L3_DEFAULT can attach with target instance or
      backend service with UNSPECIFIED protocol.
      A forwarding rule with "L3_DEFAULT" IPProtocal cannot be attached to a backend service with TCP or UDP.

      The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      [RFC1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt).

      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular
      expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.

      For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
      APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a 1-20 characters string with
      lowercase letters and numbers and must start with a letter.

      The `portRange` field has the following limitations:
      * It requires that the forwarding rule `IPProtocol` be TCP, UDP, or SCTP,
      and
      * It's applicable only to the following products: external passthrough
      Network Load Balancers, internal and external proxy Network Load
      Balancers, internal and external Application Load Balancers, external
      protocol forwarding, and Classic VPN.
      * Some products have restrictions on what ports can be used. See
      [port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications)
      for details.

      For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the
      same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair, and cannot have overlapping
      `portRange`s.

      For internal forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more
      forwarding rules cannot use the same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair, and
      cannot have overlapping `portRange`s.

      An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule.
      If specified, will be the first label of the fully qualified service
      name.

      The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
      must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.

      this field can only be used with a regional Forwarding Rule whose scheme
      is EXTERNAL. Each sourceIpRange entry should be either an IP address (for
