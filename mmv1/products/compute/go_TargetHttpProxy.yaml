      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.

    type: Integer
    description: |
      Specifies how long to keep a connection open, after completing a response,
      while there is no matching traffic (in seconds). If an HTTP keepalive is
      not specified, a default value (610 seconds) will be used. For Global
      external HTTP(S) load balancer, the minimum allowed value is 5 seconds and
      the maximum allowed value is 1200 seconds. For Global external HTTP(S)
      load balancer (classic), this option is not available publicly.
