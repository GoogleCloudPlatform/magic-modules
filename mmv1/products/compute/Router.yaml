      Name of the resource. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and

      which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all

      except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

  # TODO: Figure out the story for interfaces/bgpPeers. Right

  # these fields to the Terraform resource (and then within that, decide
  # whether to deprecate router_interface and router_peer or leave them
  # alone).

          The interval in seconds between BGP keepalive messages that are sent

          allowed to elapse between successive keepalive messages that BGP
          receives from a peer.

          BGP will use the smaller of either the local hold time value or the
          peer's hold time value as the hold time for the BGP connection
          between the two peers. If set, this value must be between 20 and 60.
