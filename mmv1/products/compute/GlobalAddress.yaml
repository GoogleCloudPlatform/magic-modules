properties:
  - name: 'address'
    type: String
    description: |
      The IP address or beginning of the address range represented by this
      resource. This can be supplied as an input to reserve a specific
      address or omitted to allow GCP to choose a valid one for you.
    default_from_api: true
  - name: 'creationTimestamp'
    type: Time
    description: |
      Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

  - name: 'description'
    type: String
    description: |
      An optional description of this resource.
  - name: 'name'
    type: String
    description: |
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035.  Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and
      match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means
      the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    required: true

    description: |
      The endpoint type of this address, which should be VM or NETLB. This is

    enum_values:
      - 'VM'
      - 'NETLB'
  - name: 'networkTier'
    type: Enum
    description: |
      The networking tier used for configuring this address. If this field is not
      specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
      This argument should not be used when configuring Internal addresses, because [network tier cannot be set for internal traffic; it's always Premium](https://cloud.google.com/network-tiers/docs/overview).

      when purpose=PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT
    default_from_api: true
  - name: 'addressType'
    type: Enum
    description: |

  - name: 'subnetwork'
    type: ResourceRef
    description: |
      The URL of the subnetwork in which to reserve the address. If an IP
      address is specified, it must be within the subnetwork's IP range.
      This field can only be used with INTERNAL type with
      GCE_ENDPOINT/DNS_RESOLVER purposes.

      * Full resource URL, as in `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{{projectId}}/regions/{{region}}/publicDelegatedPrefixes/{{pdp-name}}`
