description: |
  An SslCertificate resource, used for HTTPS load balancing.  This resource
  represents a certificate for which the certificate secrets are created and
  managed by Google.

  For a resource where you provide the key, see the
  SSL Certificate resource.

  warning: |
    This resource should be used with extreme caution!  Provisioning an SSL
    certificate is complex.  Ensure that you understand the lifecycle of a
    certificate before attempting complex tasks like cert rotation automatically.
    This resource will "return" as soon as the certificate object is created,
    but post-creation the certificate object will go through a "provisioning"
    process.  The provisioning process can complete only when the domain name
    for which the certificate is created points to a target pool which, itself,
    points at the certificate.  Depending on your DNS provider, this may take
    some time, and migrating from self-managed certificates to Google-managed
    certificates may entail some downtime while the certificate provisions.

    In conclusion: Be extremely cautious.

      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.

      These are in the same namespace as the managed SSL certificates.
