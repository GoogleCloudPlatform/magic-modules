      Represents an Address resource.

      Each virtual machine instance has an ephemeral internal IP address and,
      optionally, an external IP address. To communicate between instances on
      the same network, you can use an instance's internal IP address. To
      communicate with the Internet and instances outside of the same network,
      you must specify the instance's external IP address.

      Internal IP addresses are ephemeral and only belong to an instance for
      the lifetime of the instance; if the instance is deleted and recreated,
      the instance is assigned a new internal IP address, either by Compute
      Engine or by you. External IP addresses can be either ephemeral or
      static.

                  value of this metric, the metric itself should not change value due
                  to group resizing.

                  For example, a good metric to use with the target is
                  `pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages`
                  or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to
                  your instances.

                  A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median
                  latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a
                  single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target
                  instead.

                  to increase or decrease proportionally to the metric.

                  For example, a good metric to use as a utilizationTarget is
                  www.googleapis.com/compute/instance/network/received_bytes_count.
                  The autoscaler will work to keep this value constant for each

                  A filter string to be used as the filter string for
                  a Stackdriver Monitoring TimeSeries.list API call.
                  This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for
                  the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric
                  is exporting per-instance or per-group data.

                  You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
                  You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
                  any functions for each selector.
                  You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
                  metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
                  be identical.

                  The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
                  expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
                  expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
                  instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
                  labels.

                  If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
                  this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
                  instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
                  point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
                  This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.

                  If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.

                  You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
                  one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
                  (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
                  TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
                  will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

                are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.

                For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
                endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
                located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.

                Network Endpoint Group backends.

                Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
                partial URL.

          The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.

                          is selected in round robin order.

          * LEAST_REQUEST - An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
                            hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.

          * RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
                        hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
                        addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
                        1/N of the requests.

          * RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.

          * ORIGINAL_DESTINATION - Backend host is selected based on the client
                                   connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
                                   to the same address as the destination address of
                                   the incoming connection before the connection
                                   was redirected to the load balancer.

          * MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
                     Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
                     build times and host selection times. For more information about
                     Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824

          The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
          The possible values are -

          * ROUND_ROBIN - This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
                          is selected in round robin order.

          * LEAST_REQUEST - An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
                            hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.

          * RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
                        hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
                        addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
                        1/N of the requests.

          * RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.

          * ORIGINAL_DESTINATION - Backend host is selected based on the client
                                   connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
                                   to the same address as the destination address of
                                   the incoming connection before the connection
                                   was redirected to the load balancer.

          * MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
                     Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
                     build times and host selection times. For more information about
                     Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824

      Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to
      the physical disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the
      hardware behind these devices to ensure data redundancy and optimize
      performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard
      hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).

      Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine
      instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data
      even after you delete your instances. Persistent disk performance scales
      automatically with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks
      or add more persistent disks to an instance to meet your performance and
      storage space requirements.

      Add a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and
      affordable storage with consistent performance characteristics.

    description: |
      Health Checks determine whether instances are responsive and able to do work.
      They are an important part of a comprehensive load balancing configuration,
      as they enable monitoring instances behind load balancers.

      Health Checks poll instances at a specified interval. Instances that
      do not respond successfully to some number of probes in a row are marked
      as unhealthy. No new connections are sent to unhealthy instances,
      though existing connections will continue. The health check will
      continue to poll unhealthy instances. If an instance later responds
      successfully to some number of consecutive probes, it is marked
      healthy again and can receive new connections.

      ~>**NOTE**: Legacy HTTP(S) health checks must be used for target pool-based network
      load balancers. See the [official guide](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/health-check-concepts#selecting_hc)
      for choosing a type of health check.

      Represents an Image resource.

      Google Compute Engine uses operating system images to create the root
      persistent disks for your instances. You specify an image when you create
      an instance. Images contain a boot loader, an operating system, and a
      root file system. Linux operating system images are also capable of
      running containers on Compute Engine.

      Images can be either public or custom.

      Public images are provided and maintained by Google, open-source
      communities, and third-party vendors. By default, all projects have
      access to these images and can use them to create instances.  Custom
      images are available only to your project. You can create a custom image
      from root persistent disks and other images. Then, use the custom image
      to create an instance.

    description: |
      Network endpoint groups (NEGs) are zonal resources that represent
      collections of IP address and port combinations for GCP resources within a
      single subnet. Each IP address and port combination is called a network
      endpoint.

      Network endpoint groups can be used as backends in backend services for
      HTTP(S), TCP proxy, and SSL proxy load balancers. You cannot use NEGs as a
      backend with internal load balancers. Because NEG backends allow you to
      specify IP addresses and ports, you can distribute traffic in a granular
      fashion among applications or containers running within VM instances.

      Recreating a network endpoint group that's in use by another resource will give a
      `resourceInUseByAnotherResource` error. Use `lifecycle.create_before_destroy`
      to avoid this type of error.

                  If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that represents the
                  total amount of work to be done or resource usage, set this value to
                  an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled group.
                  The autoscaler will keep the number of instances proportional to the
                  value of this metric, the metric itself should not change value due
                  to group resizing.

                  For example, a good metric to use with the target is
                  `pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages`
                  or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to

                  A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median
                  latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a
                  single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target

                  The autoscaler will work to keep this value constant for each

                  A filter string to be used as the filter string for
                  a Stackdriver Monitoring TimeSeries.list API call.
                  This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for
                  the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric
                  is exporting per-instance or per-group data.

                  You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
                  You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
                  any functions for each selector.
                  You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
                  metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
                  be identical.

                  The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
                  expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
                  expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
                  instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
                  labels.

                  If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
                  this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
                  instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
                  point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
                  This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.

                  If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.

                  You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
                  one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
                  (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
                  TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
                  will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

      Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to
      the physical disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the
      hardware behind these devices to ensure data redundancy and optimize
      performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard
      hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).

      Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine
      instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data
      even after you delete your instances. Persistent disk performance scales
      automatically with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks
      or add more persistent disks to an instance to meet your performance and
      storage space requirements.

      Add a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and
      affordable storage with consistent performance characteristics.

          After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must
          provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk
          snapshot or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).

          Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
          the disk.

          If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then
          the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and

                      in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                      in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                      a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
                      that matches the request is applied.

                      You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                      Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and

                      Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                      in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                      you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
                      future without any impact on existing rules.

                              * 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
                                any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
                                example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
                                streams.
                              * gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
                                502, 503 or 504.
                              * connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
                                connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                              * retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                                Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                              * refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                                REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                              * cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                                header is set to cancelled
                              * deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
                                gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                              * resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                                header is set to resource-exhausted
                              * unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in
                                the response header is set to unavailable

                              - 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
                              any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
                              example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
                              streams.
                              - gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
                              502, 503 or 504.
                              - connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
                              connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                              - retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                              Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                              - refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                              REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                              - cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                              header is set to cancelled
                              - deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
                              gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                              - resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response

                              - unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if
                              the gRPC status code in the response header is set to unavailable

      Health Checks determine whether instances are responsive and able to do work.
      They are an important part of a comprehensive load balancing configuration,
      as they enable monitoring instances behind load balancers.

      Health Checks poll instances at a specified interval. Instances that
      do not respond successfully to some number of probes in a row are marked
      as unhealthy. No new connections are sent to unhealthy instances,
      though existing connections will continue. The health check will
      continue to poll unhealthy instances. If an instance later responds
      successfully to some number of consecutive probes, it is marked
      healthy again and can receive new connections.

      Represents a Route resource.

      A route is a rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by
      the virtual network. Routes are associated with virtual machines by tag,
      and the set of routes for a particular virtual machine is called its
      routing table. For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system
      searches that virtual machine's routing table for a single best matching
      route.

      Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more
      specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects
      the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it
      uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the
      remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by
      the next_hop field of the winning route -- either to another virtual
      machine destination, a virtual machine gateway or a Compute
      Engine-operated gateway. Packets that do not match any route in the
      sending virtual machine's routing table will be dropped.

      A Route resource must have exactly one specification of either
      nextHopGateway, nextHopInstance, nextHopIp, nextHopVpnTunnel, or
      nextHopIlb.

      Represents a Persistent Disk Snapshot resource.

      Use snapshots to back up data from your persistent disks. Snapshots are
      different from public images and custom images, which are used primarily
      to create instances or configure instance templates. Snapshots are useful
      for periodic backup of the data on your persistent disks. You can create
      snapshots from persistent disks even while they are attached to running
      instances.

      Snapshots are incremental, so you can create regular snapshots on a
      persistent disk faster and at a much lower cost than if you regularly
      created a full image of the disk.
    # 'createSnapshot' is a zonal operation while 'snapshot.delete' is a global
    # operation. we'll leave the object as global operation and use the disk's
    # zonal operation for the create action.

      A VPC network is a virtual version of the traditional physical networks
      that exist within and between physical data centers. A VPC network
      provides connectivity for your Compute Engine virtual machine (VM)
      instances, Container Engine containers, App Engine Flex services, and
      other network-related resources.

      Each GCP project contains one or more VPC networks. Each VPC network is a
      global entity spanning all GCP regions. This global VPC network allows VM
      instances and other resources to communicate with each other via internal,
      private IP addresses.

      Each VPC network is subdivided into subnets, and each subnet is contained
      within a single region. You can have more than one subnet in a region for
      a given VPC network. Each subnet has a contiguous private RFC1918 IP
      space. You create instances, containers, and the like in these subnets.
      When you create an instance, you must create it in a subnet, and the
      instance draws its internal IP address from that subnet.

      Virtual machine (VM) instances in a VPC network can communicate with
      instances in all other subnets of the same VPC network, regardless of
      region, using their RFC1918 private IP addresses. You can isolate portions
      of the network, even entire subnets, using firewall rules.

                              * 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
                              any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
                              example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
                              streams.
                              * gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
                              502, 503 or 504.
                              * connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
                              connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                              * retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                              Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                              * refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                              REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                              * cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                              header is set to cancelled
                              * deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
                              gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                              * resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                              header is set to resource-exhausted
                              * unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if

                      a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule

                              * 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with
                                any 5xx response code, or if the backend service does not respond at all,
                                example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused
                                streams.
                              * gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
                                502, 503 or 504.
                              * connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures
                                connecting to backend services, for example due to connection timeouts.
                              * retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                                Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                              * refused-stream: Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a
                                REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                              * cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                                header is set to cancelled
                              * deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the
                                gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                              * resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response
                                header is set to resource-exhausted
                              * unavailable: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in
                                the response header is set to unavailable

                        * 5xx: Loadbalancer will attempt a retry if the backend service responds with any 5xx response code,
                          or if the backend service does not respond at all, example: disconnects, reset, read timeout,
                        * connection failure, and refused streams.
                        * gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504.
                        * connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures connecting to backend services,
                          for example due to connection timeouts.
                        * retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.
                          Currently the only retriable error supported is 409.
                        * refused-stream:Loadbalancer will retry if the backend service resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM error code.
                          This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                        * cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to cancelled
                        * deadline-exceeded: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded
                        * resource-exhausted: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to resource-exhausted

              The weights determine the fraction of traffic that flows to their corresponding backend service.

              advanced routing actions like Url rewrites and header transformations are applied depending on

                  * connect-failure: Loadbalancer will retry on failures connecting to backend services,
                    for example due to connection timeouts.
                  * retriable-4xx: Loadbalancer will retry for retriable 4xx response codes.

                    This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                  * cancelled: Loadbalancer will retry if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to cancelled
