name: 'InstanceGroup'
kind: 'compute#instanceGroup'
description: |
  Represents an Instance Group resource. Instance groups are self-managed
  and can contain identical or different instances. Instance groups do not
  use an instance template. Unlike managed instance groups, you must create
  and add instances to an instance group manually.

      The name of the instance group.

  - name: 'namedPorts'
    type: Array
    description: |
      Assigns a name to a port number.
      For example: {name: "http", port: 80}.

      This allows the system to reference ports by the assigned name
      instead of a port number. Named ports can also contain multiple
      ports.

      For example: [{name: "http", port: 80},{name: "http", port: 8080}]

      Named ports apply to all instances in this instance group.
