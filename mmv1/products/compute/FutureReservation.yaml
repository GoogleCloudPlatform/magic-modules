name: 'FutureReservation'
description: |
  Represents a future reservation resource in Compute Engine. Future reservations allow users
  to reserve capacity for a specified time window, ensuring that resources are available
  when needed.

  Reservations apply only to Compute Engine, Cloud Dataproc, and Google
  Kubernetes Engine VM usage.Reservations do not apply to `f1-micro` or
  `g1-small` machine types, preemptible VMs, sole tenant nodes, or other
  services not listed above
  like Cloud SQL and Dataflow.
