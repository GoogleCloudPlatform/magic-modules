  Represents an Image resource.

  Google Compute Engine uses operating system images to create the root
  persistent disks for your instances. You specify an image when you create
  an instance. Images contain a boot loader, an operating system, and a
  root file system. Linux operating system images are also capable of
  running containers on Compute Engine.

  Images can be either public or custom.

  Public images are provided and maintained by Google, open-source
  communities, and third-party vendors. By default, all projects have
  access to these images and can use them to create instances.  Custom
  images are available only to your project. You can create a custom image
  from root persistent disks and other images. Then, use the custom image
  to create an instance.
