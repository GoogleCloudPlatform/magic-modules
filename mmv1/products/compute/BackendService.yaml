description: |
  A Backend Service defines a group of virtual machines that will serve
  traffic for load balancing. This resource is a global backend service,
  appropriate for external load balancing or self-managed internal load balancing.
  For managed internal load balancing, use a regional backend service instead.

  Currently self-managed internal load balancing is only available in beta.

            of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
            instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
            the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
            are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.

            For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
            endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
            located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.

            Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and
            Network Endpoint Group backends.

            Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
            Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a
            partial URL.

    description: |
      The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
      The possible values are:

      * `ROUND_ROBIN`: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
                       is selected in round robin order.

      * `LEAST_REQUEST`: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
                         hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.

      * `RING_HASH`: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
                     hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
                     addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
                     1/N of the requests.

      * `RANDOM`: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.

      * `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`: Backend host is selected based on the client
                                connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
                                to the same address as the destination address of
                                the incoming connection before the connection
                                was redirected to the load balancer.

      * `MAGLEV`: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
                  Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
                  build times and host selection times. For more information about
                  Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824

      * `WEIGHTED_MAGLEV`: Per-instance weighted Load Balancing via health check
                           reported weights. If set, the Backend Service must
                           configure a non legacy HTTP-based Health Check, and
                           health check replies are expected to contain
                           non-standard HTTP response header field
                           X-Load-Balancing-Endpoint-Weight to specify the
                           per-instance weights. If set, Load Balancing is weight
                           based on the per-instance weights reported in the last
                           processed health check replies, as long as every
                           instance either reported a valid weight or had
                           UNAVAILABLE_WEIGHT. Otherwise, Load Balancing remains
                           equal-weight.


      This field is applicable to either:

      * A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2,
        and loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED.
      * A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
      * A regional backend service with loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL (External Network
        Load Balancing). Only MAGLEV and WEIGHTED_MAGLEV values are possible for External
        Network Load Balancing. The default is MAGLEV.


      If session_affinity is not NONE, and this field is not set to MAGLEV, WEIGHTED_MAGLEV,
      or RING_HASH, session affinity settings will not take effect.

      Only ROUND_ROBIN and RING_HASH are supported when the backend service is referenced
      by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validate_for_proxyless
      field set to true.

              description: |
                The name of a locality load balancer policy to be used. The value
                should be one of the predefined ones as supported by localityLbPolicy,
                although at the moment only ROUND_ROBIN is supported.

                This field should only be populated when the customPolicy field is not
                used.

                Note that specifying the same policy more than once for a backend is
                not a valid configuration and will be rejected.

                The possible values are:

                * `ROUND_ROBIN`: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
                                is selected in round robin order.

                * `LEAST_REQUEST`: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
                                  hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.

                * `RING_HASH`: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
                              hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
                              addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
                              1/N of the requests.

                * `RANDOM`: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.

                * `ORIGINAL_DESTINATION`: Backend host is selected based on the client
                                          connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
                                          to the same address as the destination address of
                                          the incoming connection before the connection
                                          was redirected to the load balancer.

                * `MAGLEV`: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
                            Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
                            build times and host selection times. For more information about
                            Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
