  Represents a Target gRPC Proxy resource. A target gRPC proxy is a component
  of load balancers intended for load balancing gRPC traffic. Global forwarding
  rules reference a target gRPC proxy. The Target gRPC Proxy references
  a URL map which specifies how traffic routes to gRPC backend services.

    description: |
      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource
      is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply
      with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long
      and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which
      means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all
      following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit,
      except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

      must be set to GRPC.

      If true, indicates that the BackendServices referenced by
      the urlMap may be accessed by gRPC applications without using
      a sidecar proxy. This will enable configuration checks on urlMap
      and its referenced BackendServices to not allow unsupported features.
      A gRPC application must use "xds:///" scheme in the target URI
      of the service it is connecting to. If false, indicates that the
      BackendServices referenced by the urlMap will be accessed by gRPC
      applications via a sidecar proxy. In this case, a gRPC application
      must not use "xds:///" scheme in the target URI of the service
      it is connecting to
    immutable: true
  - name: 'fingerprint'
    type: Fingerprint
    description: |
      Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in
      this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a TargetGrpcProxy. An up-to-date
      fingerprint must be provided in order to patch/update the
      TargetGrpcProxy; otherwise, the request will fail with error
      412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get()
      request to retrieve the TargetGrpcProxy. A base64-encoded string.
