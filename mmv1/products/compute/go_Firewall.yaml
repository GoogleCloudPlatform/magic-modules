  Each network has its own firewall controlling access to and from the
  instances.

  All traffic to instances, even from other instances, is blocked by the
  firewall unless firewall rules are created to allow it.

  The default network has automatically created firewall rules that are
  shown in default firewall rules. No manually created network has
  automatically created firewall rules except for a default "allow" rule for
  outgoing traffic and a default "deny" for incoming traffic. For all
  networks except the default network, you must create any firewall rules
  you need.
