description: |
  A global network endpoint group contains endpoints that reside outside of Google Cloud.
  Currently a global network endpoint group can only support a single endpoint.

  Recreating a global network endpoint group that's in use by another resource will give a
  `resourceInUseByAnotherResource` error. Use `lifecycle.create_before_destroy`
  to avoid this type of error.

      Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
