  Represents a SSL policy. SSL policies give you the ability to control the
  features of SSL that your SSL proxy or HTTPS load balancer negotiates.

      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.

      Profile specifies the set of SSL features that can be used by the
      load balancer when negotiating SSL with clients. If using `CUSTOM`,
      the set of SSL features to enable must be specified in the
      `customFeatures` field.

      See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/ssl-policies#profilefeaturesupport)
      for information on what cipher suites each profile provides. If
      `CUSTOM` is used, the `custom_features` attribute **must be set**.

      See the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/ssl-policies#profilefeaturesupport)
      for which ciphers are available to use. **Note**: this argument
      *must* be present when using the `CUSTOM` profile. This argument
      *must not* be present when using any other profile.
