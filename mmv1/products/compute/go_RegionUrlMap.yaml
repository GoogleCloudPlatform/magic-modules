  UrlMaps are used to route requests to a backend service based on rules
  that you define for the host and path of an incoming URL.

            action to take effect. Within a given pathMatcher, only one of pathRules or
            routeRules must be set. routeRules are not supported in UrlMaps intended for

                  For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines the order
                  in which load balancer will interpret routeRules. RouteRules are evaluated
                  in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of
                  a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule
                  that matches the request is applied.

                  You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority.
                  Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and
                  2147483647 inclusive.

                  Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules
                  in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example,
                  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which
                  you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the
                  future without any impact on existing rules.

                - 5xx : retry is attempted if the instance or endpoint responds with any 5xx response code, or if the instance or endpoint does not respond at all. For example, disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused streams.

                - retriable-4xx : a retry is attempted if the instance or endpoint responds with a 4xx response code. The only error that you can retry is error code 409.
                - refused-stream : a retry is attempted if the instance or endpoint resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry.
                - cancelled : a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to cancelled.
                - deadline-exceeded : a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to deadline-exceeded.

          The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test the resiliency of clients to backend service failure.
          As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by a load balancer on a percentage of requests before sending those requests to the backend service.
          Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the load balancer for a percentage of requests.
          timeout and retryPolicy is ignored by clients that are configured with a faultInjectionPolicy if: 1. The traffic is generated by fault injection AND 2. The fault injection is not a delay fault injection.
          Fault injection is not supported with the global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic). To see which load balancers support fault injection, see Load balancing: [Routing and traffic management features](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/features#routing-traffic-management).
