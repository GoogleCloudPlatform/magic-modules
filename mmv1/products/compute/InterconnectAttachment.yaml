    description: |
      URL of addresses that have been reserved for the interconnect
      attachment, Used only for interconnect attachment that has the
      encryption option as IPSEC.

      The addresses must be RFC 1918 IP address ranges. When creating HA
      VPN gateway over the interconnect attachment, if the attachment is
      configured to use an RFC 1918 IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP
      address will be allocated from the IP address range specified
      here.

      For example, if the HA VPN gateway's interface 0 is paired to this
      interconnect attachment, then an RFC 1918 IP address for the VPN
      gateway interface 0 will be allocated from the IP address specified
      for this interconnect attachment.

      If this field is not specified for interconnect attachment that has
      encryption option as IPSEC, later on when creating HA VPN gateway on
      this interconnect attachment, the HA VPN gateway's IP address will be
      allocated from regional external IP address pool.

  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Enum
    name: 'encryption'
    description: |
      Indicates the user-supplied encryption option of this interconnect
      attachment:

      NONE is the default value, which means that the attachment carries
      unencrypted traffic. VMs can send traffic to, or receive traffic
      from, this type of attachment.

      IPSEC indicates that the attachment carries only traffic encrypted by
      an IPsec device such as an HA VPN gateway. VMs cannot directly send
      traffic to, or receive traffic from, such an attachment. To use
      IPsec-encrypted Cloud Interconnect create the attachment using this
      option.

      Not currently available publicly.

    values:
      - :NONE
