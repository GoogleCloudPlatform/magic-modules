      IPSEC.

      The addresses must be RFC 1918 IP address ranges. When creating HA VPN
      gateway over the interconnect attachment, if the attachment is configured
      to use an RFC 1918 IP address, then the VPN gateway's IP address will be
      allocated from the IP address range specified here.

      For example, if the HA VPN gateway's interface 0 is paired to this
      interconnect attachment, then an RFC 1918 IP address for the VPN gateway
      interface 0 will be allocated from the IP address specified for this
      interconnect attachment.

      If this field is not specified for interconnect attachment that has
      encryption option as IPSEC, later on when creating HA VPN gateway on this
      interconnect attachment, the HA VPN gateway's IP address will be
      allocated from regional external IP address pool.

      Indicates the user-supplied encryption option of this interconnect
      attachment. Can only be specified at attachment creation for PARTNER or
      DEDICATED attachments.

      * NONE - This is the default value, which means that the VLAN attachment
      carries unencrypted traffic. VMs are able to send traffic to, or receive
      traffic from, such a VLAN attachment.

      * IPSEC - The VLAN attachment carries only encrypted traffic that is
      encrypted by an IPsec device, such as an HA VPN gateway or third-party
      IPsec VPN. VMs cannot directly send traffic to, or receive traffic from,
      such a VLAN attachment. To use HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect, the VLAN
      attachment must be created with this option.
