  Represents a Managed Instance Group Resize Request

  Resize Requests are the Managed Instance Group implementation of Dynamic Workload Scheduler Flex Start.

  With Dynamic Workload Scheduler in Flex Start mode, you submit a GPU capacity request for your AI/ML jobs by indicating how many you need, a duration, and your preferred region. Dynamic Workload Scheduler intelligently persists the request; once the capacity becomes available, it automatically provisions your VMs enabling your workloads to run continuously for the entire duration of the capacity allocation.

### Create Method ###
# Get method with a post

### Update method ###
# Resize requests are currently not update-able

### Delete Method ###
# Custom delete method to handle resize request cancellations vs. deletions.
# If a resize request is in the ACCEPTED state, it must be canceled before it can be
# deleted. If a resize request is NOT in the ACCEPTED state, it can be directly deleted.

                              Keys must match /[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9-_]+/ but should ideally be lowerCamelCase. Also they must be limited to 64 characters in length. When identifying the current value of an exceeded limit, the units should be contained in the key, not the value. For example, rather than {"instanceLimit": "100/request"}, should be returned as, {"instanceLimitPerRequest": "100"}, if the client exceeds the number of instances that can be created in a single (batch) request.
