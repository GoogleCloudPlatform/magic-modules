  Defines an Instance Template resource that provides configuration settings
  for your virtual machine instances. Instance templates are not tied to the
  lifetime of an instance and can be used and reused as to deploy virtual
  machines. You can also use different templates to create different virtual
  machine configurations. Instance templates are required when you create a
  managed instance group.

  Tip: Disks should be set to autoDelete=true
  so that leftover disks are not left behind on machine deletion.
