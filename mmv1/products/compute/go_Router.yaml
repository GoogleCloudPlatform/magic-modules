      which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all

      except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

        description: |
          The interval in seconds between BGP keepalive messages that are sent
          to the peer. Hold time is three times the interval at which keepalive
          messages are sent, and the hold time is the maximum number of seconds
          allowed to elapse between successive keepalive messages that BGP
          receives from a peer.

          BGP will use the smaller of either the local hold time value or the
          peer's hold time value as the hold time for the BGP connection
          between the two peers. If set, this value must be between 20 and 60.
          The default is 20.

          It is provided as a link-local IPv4 range (from 169.254.0.0/16), of
          size at least /30, even if the BGP sessions are over IPv6. It must
          not overlap with any IPv4 BGP session ranges. Other vendors commonly
          call this router ID.
