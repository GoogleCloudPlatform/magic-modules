          decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.

          The maximum number of replicas this DeployedModel may be
          deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If the
          requested value is too large, the deployment will error, but if
          deployment succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that
          many replicas is guaranteed (barring service outages). If
          traffic against the DeployedModel increases beyond what its
          replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be
          dropped. If this value is not provided, will use
          min_replica_count as the default value. The value of this field
          impacts the charge against Vertex CPU and GPU quotas.
          Specifically, you will be charged for max_replica_count * number
          of cores in the selected machine type) and (max_replica_count *
          number of GPUs per replica in the selected machine type).

            one entry is allowed per metric. If
            machine_spec.accelerator_count is above 0, the autoscaling
            will be based on both CPU utilization and accelerator's duty
            cycle metrics and scale up when either metrics exceeds its
            target value while scale down if both metrics are under their
            target value. The default target value is 60 for both metrics.
            If machine_spec.accelerator_count is 0, the autoscaling will
            be based on CPU utilization metric only with default target
            value 60 if not explicitly set. For example, in the case of
            Online Prediction, if you want to override target CPU
            utilization to 80, you should set
            autoscaling_metric_specs.metric_name to
            `aiplatform.googleapis.com/prediction/online/cpu/utilization`
            and autoscaling_metric_specs.target to `80`.
