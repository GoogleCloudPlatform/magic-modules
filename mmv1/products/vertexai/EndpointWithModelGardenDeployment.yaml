    properties:
    - name: ports
      type: Array
      description: |-
        List of ports to expose from the container. Vertex AI sends any
        prediction requests that it receives to the first port on this list. Vertex

        [liveness and health
        checks](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/custom-container-requirements#liveness)
        to this port.

        If you do not specify this field, it defaults to following value:

        ```json
        [
        {
        "containerPort": 8080
        }
        ]

        Vertex AI does not use ports other than the first one listed. This field
        corresponds to the `ports` field of the Kubernetes Containers

        container's response in the API response.

        For example, if you set this field to `/foo`, then when Vertex AI
        receives a prediction request, it forwards the request body in a POST
        request to the `/foo` path on the port of your container specified by the
        first value of this `ModelContainerSpec`'s
        ports field.

        If you don't specify this field, it defaults to the following value when
        you deploy this Model to an Endpoint:/v1/endpoints/ENDPOINT/deployedModels/DEPLOYED_MODEL:predict
        The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows:

        * ENDPOINT: The last segment (following `endpoints/`)of the
        Endpoint.name][] field of the Endpoint where this Model has been
        deployed. (Vertex AI makes this value available to your container code
        as the [`AIP_ENDPOINT_ID` environment

        [health

        Specify this field as an array of executable and arguments, similar to a
        Docker `ENTRYPOINT`'s "exec" form, not its "shell" form.

        If you do not specify this field, then the container's `ENTRYPOINT` runs,
        in conjunction with the args field or the
        container's [`CMD`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd),
        if either exists. If this field is not specified and the container does not

        interact](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-cmd-and-entrypoint-interact).

        If you specify this field, then you can also specify the `args` field to
        provide additional arguments for this command. However, if you specify this
        field, then the container's `CMD` is ignored. See the

        If you don't specify this field but do specify the

        If you don't specify this field and don't specify the `command` field,
        then the container's
        [`ENTRYPOINT`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) and
