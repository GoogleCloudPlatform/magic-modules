        The DeployedIndex may depend on various data on its original Index. Additionally when certain changes to the original Index are being done (e.g. when what the Index contains is being changed) the DeployedIndex may be asynchronously updated in the background to reflect these changes. If this timestamp's value is at least the [Index.update_time](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.indexes#Index.FIELDS.update_time) of the original Index, it means that this DeployedIndex and the original Index are in sync. If this timestamp is older, then to see which updates this DeployedIndex already contains (and which it does not), one must [list](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.operations/list#google.longrunning.Operations.ListOperations) the operations that are running on the original Index. Only the successfully completed Operations with updateTime equal or before this sync time are contained in this DeployedIndex.

        A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, with nanosecond resolution and up to nine fractional digits. Examples: "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z" and "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error.

                The maximum number of replicas this DeployedModel may be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If the requested value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment succeeds then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas is guaranteed (barring service outages). If traffic against the DeployedModel increases beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic will be dropped. If this value is not provided, a no upper bound for scaling under heavy traffic will be assume, though Vertex AI may be unable to scale beyond certain replica number.

        A description of resources that are dedicated to the DeployedIndex, and that need a higher degree of manual configuration. The field minReplicaCount must be set to a value strictly greater than 0, or else validation will fail. We don't provide SLA when minReplicaCount=1. If maxReplicaCount is not set, the default value is minReplicaCount. The max allowed replica count is 1000.

        Available machine types for SMALL shard: e2-standard-2 and all machine types available for MEDIUM and LARGE shard.

        Available machine types for MEDIUM shard: e2-standard-16 and all machine types available for LARGE shard.

        Available machine types for LARGE shard: e2-highmem-16, n2d-standard-32.

        n1-standard-16 and n1-standard-32 are still available, but we recommend e2-standard-16 and e2-highmem-16 for cost efficiency.

      The deployment group can be no longer than 64 characters (eg: 'test', 'prod'). If not set, we will use the 'default' deployment group.
      Creating deployment_groups with reserved_ip_ranges is a recommended practice when the peered network has multiple peering ranges. This creates your deployments from predictable IP spaces for easier traffic administration. Also, one deployment_group (except 'default') can only be used with the same reserved_ip_ranges which means if the deployment_group has been used with reserved_ip_ranges: [a, b, c], using it with [a, b] or [d, e] is disallowed. [See the official documentation here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.indexEndpoints#DeployedIndex.FIELDS.deployment_group).
      Note: we only support up to 5 deployment groups (not including 'default').
