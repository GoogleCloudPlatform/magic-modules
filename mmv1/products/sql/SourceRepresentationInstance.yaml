  A source representation instance is a Cloud SQL instance that represents
  the source database server to the Cloud SQL replica. It is visible in the
  Cloud Console and appears the same as a regular Cloud SQL instance, but it
  contains no data, requires no configuration or maintenance, and does not
  affect billing. You cannot update the source representation instance.
