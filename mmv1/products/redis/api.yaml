        description: |
          Output only. Hostname or IP address of the exposed readonly Redis endpoint. Standard tier only.
          Targets all healthy replica nodes in instance. Replication is asynchronous and replica nodes
          will exhibit some lag behind the primary. Write requests must target 'host'.

        name: readEndpointPort
        description: |
          Output only. The port number of the exposed readonly redis endpoint. Standard tier only.
          Write requests should target 'port'.

        description: |
          Optional. Read replica mode. Can only be specified when trying to create the instance.
          If not set, Memorystore Redis backend will default to READ_REPLICAS_DISABLED.
          - READ_REPLICAS_DISABLED: If disabled, read endpoint will not be provided and the
          instance cannot scale up or down the number of replicas.
          - READ_REPLICAS_ENABLED: If enabled, read endpoint will be provided and the instance
          can scale up and down the number of replicas.
        values:
          - :READ_REPLICAS_DISABLED
          - :READ_REPLICAS_ENABLED

        description: |
          Optional. Additional IP range for node placement. Required when enabling read replicas on
          an existing instance. For DIRECT_PEERING mode value must be a CIDR range of size /28, or
          "auto". For PRIVATE_SERVICE_ACCESS mode value must be the name of an allocated address
          range associated with the private service access connection, or "auto".

          Optional. The KMS key reference that you want to use to encrypt the data at rest for this Redis
          instance. If this is provided, CMEK is enabled.
