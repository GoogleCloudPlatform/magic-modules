          This field together with MediaRecommendationEngineConfig.type describes
          engine metadata to use to control engine training and serving.
          Currently supported values: `ctr`, `cvr`.
          If not specified, we choose default based on engine type. Default depends on type of recommendation:

        description: |
          The training state that the engine is in (e.g. `TRAINING` or `PAUSED`).
          Since part of the cost of running the service
          is frequency of training - this can be used to determine when to train
          engine in order to control cost. If not specified: the default value for
          `CreateEngine` method is `TRAINING`. The default value for
          `UpdateEngine` method is to keep the state the same as before.

                  If set to `generic`, only `view-item`, `media-play`,and
                  `media-complete` will be used as `context-event` in engine training. If
                  set to `view-home-page`, `view-home-page` will also be used as
                  `context-events` in addition to `view-item`, `media-play`, and
                  `media-complete`. Currently supported for the `recommended-for-you`
