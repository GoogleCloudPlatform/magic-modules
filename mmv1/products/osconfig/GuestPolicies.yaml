      Specifies the VM instances that are assigned to this policy. This allows you to target sets
      or groups of VM instances by different parameters such as labels, names, OS, or zones.
      If left empty, all VM instances underneath this policy are targeted.
      At the same level in the resource hierarchy (that is within a project), the service prevents
      the creation of multiple policies that conflict with each other.
      For more information, see how the service
      [handles assignment conflicts](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/os-config-management/create-guest-policy#handle-conflicts).
