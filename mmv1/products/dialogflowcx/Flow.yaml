      Marks this as the [Default Start Flow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/flow#start) for an agent. When you create an agent, the Default Start Flow is created automatically.
      The Default Start Flow cannot be deleted; deleting the `google_dialogflow_cx_flow` resource does nothing to the underlying GCP resources.

      ~> Avoid having multiple `google_dialogflow_cx_flow` resources linked to the same agent with `is_default_start_flow = true` because they will compete to control a single Default Start Flow resource in GCP.

    description: |
      A flow's transition routes serve two purposes:
      They are responsible for matching the user's first utterances in the flow.
      They are inherited by every page's [transition routes][Page.transition_routes] and can support use cases such as the user saying "help" or "can I talk to a human?", which can be handled in a common way regardless of the current page. Transition routes defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.

      TransitionRoutes are evalauted in the following order:
        TransitionRoutes with intent specified.
        TransitionRoutes with only condition specified.
        TransitionRoutes with intent specified are inherited by pages in the flow.

                      Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way. Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don't return ConversationSuccess.
                      You may set this, for example:
                      * In the entryFulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates that the conversation succeeded.
                      * In a webhook response when you determine that you handled the customer issue.

                      You may set this, for example:
                      * In the entryFulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates something went extremely wrong in the conversation.
