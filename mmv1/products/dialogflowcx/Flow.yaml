      A flow's transition routes serve two purposes:
      They are responsible for matching the user's first utterances in the flow.
      They are inherited by every page's [transition routes][Page.transition_routes] and can support use cases such as the user saying "help" or "can I talk to a human?", which can be handled in a common way regardless of the current page. Transition routes defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.

      TransitionRoutes are evalauted in the following order:
        TransitionRoutes with intent specified.
        TransitionRoutes with only condition specified.
        TransitionRoutes with intent specified are inherited by pages in the flow.

            Format: projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Location ID>/agents/<Agent ID>/intents/<Intent ID>. Indicates that the transition can only happen when the given intent is matched. At least one of intent or condition must be specified. When both intent and condition are specified, the transition can only happen when both are fulfilled.

          name: 'condition'
          description: |
            The condition to evaluate against form parameters or session parameters.
            At least one of intent or condition must be specified. When both intent and condition are specified, the transition can only happen when both are fulfilled.

                Whether Dialogflow should return currently queued fulfillment response messages in streaming APIs. If a webhook is specified, it happens before Dialogflow invokes webhook. Warning: 1) This flag only affects streaming API. Responses are still queued and returned once in non-streaming API. 2) The flag can be enabled in any fulfillment but only the first 3 partial responses will be returned. You may only want to apply it to fulfillments that have slow webhooks.

    name: 'eventHandlers'
    description: |
      A flow's event handlers serve two purposes:
      They are responsible for handling events (e.g. no match, webhook errors) in the flow.
      They are inherited by every page's [event handlers][Page.event_handlers], which can be used to handle common events regardless of the current page. Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.
      Unlike transitionRoutes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.

          To filter out false positive results and still get variety in matched natural language inputs for your agent, you can tune the machine learning classification threshold.
          If the returned score value is less than the threshold value, then a no-match event will be triggered. The score values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). If set to 0.0, the default of 0.3 is used.
