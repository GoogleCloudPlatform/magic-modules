      Marks this as the [Default Start Flow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/flow#start) for an agent. When you create an agent, the Default Start Flow is created automatically.
      The Default Start Flow cannot be deleted; deleting the `google_dialogflow_cx_flow` resource does nothing to the underlying GCP resources.

      ~> Avoid having multiple `google_dialogflow_cx_flow` resources linked to the same agent with `is_default_start_flow = true` because they will compete to control a single Default Start Flow resource in GCP.

      A flow's transition routes serve two purposes:
      They are responsible for matching the user's first utterances in the flow.
      They are inherited by every page's [transition routes][Page.transition_routes] and can support use cases such as the user saying "help" or "can I talk to a human?", which can be handled in a common way regardless of the current page. Transition routes defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.

      TransitionRoutes are evalauted in the following order:
        TransitionRoutes with intent specified.
        TransitionRoutes with only condition specified.
        TransitionRoutes with intent specified are inherited by pages in the flow.

                      Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations should be counted as successful and doesn't process the metadata in this message in any way. Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don't return ConversationSuccess.
                      You may set this, for example:
                      * In the entryFulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates that the conversation succeeded.

                      Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.
                      You may set this, for example:
                      * In the entryFulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates something went extremely wrong in the conversation.

      A flow's event handlers serve two purposes:
      They are responsible for handling events (e.g. no match, webhook errors) in the flow.
      They are inherited by every page's [event handlers][Page.event_handlers], which can be used to handle common events regardless of the current page. Event handlers defined in the page have higher priority than those defined in the flow.
      Unlike transitionRoutes, these handlers are evaluated on a first-match basis. The first one that matches the event get executed, with the rest being ignored.
