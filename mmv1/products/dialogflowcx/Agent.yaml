  Agents are best described as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modules that transform user requests into actionable data. You can include agents in your app, product, or service to determine user intent and respond to the user in a natural way.

virtual_fields:
  - name: 'delete_chat_engine_on_destroy'
    description: |
      If set to `true`, Terraform will delete the chat engine associated with the agent when the agent is destroyed.
      Otherwise, the chat engine will persist.

      This virtual field addresses a critical dependency chain: `agent` -> `engine` -> `data store`. The chat engine is automatically
      provisioned when a data store is linked to the agent, meaning Terraform doesn't have direct control over its lifecycle as a managed
      resource. This creates a problem when both the agent and data store are managed by Terraform and need to be destroyed. Without
      delete_chat_engine_on_destroy set to true, the data store's deletion would fail because the unmanaged chat engine would still be
      using it. This setting ensures that the entire dependency chain can be properly torn down.
      See `mmv1/templates/terraform/examples/dialogflowcx_tool_data_store.tf.tmpl` as an example.

      Data store can be linked to an agent through the `knowledgeConnectorSettings` field of a [flow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest/v3/projects.locations.agents.flows#resource:-flow)
      or a [page](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest/v3/projects.locations.agents.flows.pages#resource:-page)
      or the `dataStoreSpec` field of a [tool](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest/v3/projects.locations.agents.tools#resource:-tool).
      The ID of the implicitly created engine is stored in the `genAppBuilderSettings` field of the [agent](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest/v3/projects.locations.agents#resource:-agent).

      ~> **Note:** The first time you are deploying an Agent in your project you must configure location settings.
       This is a one time step but at the moment you can only [configure location settings](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#location-settings) via the Dialogflow CX console.
       Another options is to use global location so you don't need to manually configure location settings.
