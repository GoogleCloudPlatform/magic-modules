  Agents are best described as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modules that transform user requests into actionable data. You can include agents in your app, product, or service to determine user intent and respond to the user in a natural way.

      ~> **Note:** The first time you are deploying an Agent in your project you must configure location settings.
       This is a one time step but at the moment you can only [configure location settings](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#location-settings) via the Dialogflow CX console.
       Another options is to use global location so you don't need to manually configure location settings.
