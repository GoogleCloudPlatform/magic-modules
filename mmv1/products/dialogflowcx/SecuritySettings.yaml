  Represents the settings related to security issues, such as data redaction and data retention. It may take hours for updates on the settings to propagate to all the related components and take effect.
  Multiple security settings can be configured in each location. Each agent can specify the security settings to apply, and each setting can be applied to multiple agents in the same project and location.

      Controls audio export settings for post-conversation analytics when ingesting audio to conversations.
      If retention_strategy is set to REMOVE_AFTER_CONVERSATION or gcs_bucket is empty, audio export is disabled.
      If audio export is enabled, audio is recorded and saved to gcs_bucket, subject to retention policy of gcs_bucket.
      This setting won't effect audio input for implicit sessions via [Sessions.DetectIntent](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/reference/rest/v3/projects.locations.agents.sessions/detectIntent#google.cloud.dialogflow.cx.v3.Sessions.DetectIntent).
