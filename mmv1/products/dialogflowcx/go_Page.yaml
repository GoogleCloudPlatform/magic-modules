Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don't return ConversationSuccess.
                You may set this, for example:
                * In the entryFulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates that the conversation succeeded.
                * In a webhook response when you determine that you handled the customer issue.

                Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent.
                Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.
                You may set this, for example:
                * In the entryFulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates something went extremely wrong in the conversation.
                * In a webhook response when you determine that the customer issue can only be handled by a human.

Warning: 1) This flag only affects streaming API.

                    [initialPromptFulfillment][initialPromptFulfillment] provides the first prompt for the parameter.
                    If the user's response does not fill the parameter, a no-match/no-input event will be triggered, and the fulfillment associated with the sys.no-match-1/sys.no-input-1 handler (if defined) will be called to provide a prompt. The sys.no-match-2/sys.no-input-2 handler (if defined) will respond to the next no-match/no-input event, and so on.
                    A sys.no-match-default or sys.no-input-default handler will be used to handle all following no-match/no-input events after all numbered no-match/no-input handlers for the parameter are consumed.
                    A sys.invalid-parameter handler can be defined to handle the case where the parameter values have been invalidated by webhook. For example, if the user's response fill the parameter, however the parameter was invalidated by webhook, the fulfillment associated with the sys.invalid-parameter handler (if defined) will be called to provide a prompt.
                    If the event handler for the corresponding event can't be found on the parameter, initialPromptFulfillment will be re-prompted.

                      Indicates that the conversation should be handed off to a live agent.
                      Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed off to a human agent for measurement purposes. What else to do with this signal is up to you and your handoff procedures.
                      You may set this, for example:
                      * In the entryFulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates something went extremely wrong in the conversation.
                      * In a webhook response when you determine that the customer issue can only be handled by a human.

                Whether Dialogflow should return currently queued fulfillment response messages in streaming APIs. If a webhook is specified, it happens before Dialogflow invokes webhook. Warning: 1) This flag only affects streaming API. Responses are still queued and returned once in non-streaming API. 2) The flag can be enabled in any fulfillment but only the first 3 partial responses will be returned. You may only want to apply it to fulfillments that have slow webhooks.

              If true, incoming audio is processed for DTMF (dual tone multi frequency) events. For example, if the caller presses a button on their telephone keypad and DTMF processing is enabled, Dialogflow will detect the event (e.g. a "3" was pressed) in the incoming audio and pass the event to the bot to drive business logic (e.g. when 3 is pressed, return the account balance).
