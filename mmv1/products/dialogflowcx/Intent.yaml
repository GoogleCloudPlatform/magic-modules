      Marks this as the [Default Welcome Intent](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/intent#welcome) for an agent. When you create an agent, a Default Welcome Intent is created automatically.
      The Default Welcome Intent cannot be deleted; deleting the `google_dialogflow_cx_intent` resource does nothing to the underlying GCP resources.

      ~> Avoid having multiple `google_dialogflow_cx_intent` resources linked to the same agent with `is_default_welcome_intent = true` because they will compete to control a single Default Welcome Intent resource in GCP.

      Marks this as the [Default Negative Intent](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/intent#negative) for an agent. When you create an agent, a Default Negative Intent is created automatically.
      The Default Negative Intent cannot be deleted; deleting the `google_dialogflow_cx_intent` resource does nothing to the underlying GCP resources.

    type: Boolean

parameters:
  - name: 'parent'
    type: String
    description: |
      The agent to create an intent for.
      Format: projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Location ID>/agents/<Agent ID>.
    url_param_only: true
    immutable: true
  - name: 'languageCode'
    type: String
    description: |
      The language of the following fields in intent:
      Intent.training_phrases.parts.text
      If not specified, the agent's default language is used. Many languages are supported. Note: languages must be enabled in the agent before they can be used.
    immutable: true
properties:
  - name: 'name'
    type: String
    description: |
      The unique identifier of the intent.
      Format: projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Location ID>/agents/<Agent ID>/intents/<Intent ID>.
    output: true
    custom_flatten: 'templates/terraform/custom_flatten/name_from_self_link.tmpl'
  - name: 'displayName'
    type: String
    description: |
      The human-readable name of the intent, unique within the agent.
    required: true
    validation:
      function: 'validation.StringLenBetween(0, 64)'
  - name: 'trainingPhrases'
    type: Array
    description: |
      The collection of training phrases the agent is trained on to identify the intent.
    item_type:
      type: NestedObject
      properties:
        - name: 'id'
          type: String
          description: |
            The unique identifier of the training phrase.
          output: true
        - name: 'parts'
          type: Array
          description: |
            The ordered list of training phrase parts. The parts are concatenated in order to form the training phrase.
            Note: The API does not automatically annotate training phrases like the Dialogflow Console does.
            Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated.
            If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set.
            If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways:
            Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters.
            Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the parameterId field is set.
          required: true
          item_type:
            type: NestedObject
            properties:
              - name: 'text'
                type: String
                description: |
                  The text for this part.
                required: true
              - name: 'parameterId'
                type: String
                description: |
                  The parameter used to annotate this part of the training phrase. This field is required for annotated parts of the training phrase.
        - name: 'repeatCount'
          type: Integer
          description: |
            Indicates how many times this example was added to the intent.
  - name: 'parameters'
    type: Array
    description: |
      The collection of parameters associated with the intent.
    item_type:
      type: NestedObject
      properties:
        - name: 'id'
          type: String
          description: |
            The unique identifier of the parameter. This field is used by training phrases to annotate their parts.
          required: true
        - name: 'entityType'
          type: String
          description: |
            The entity type of the parameter.
            Format: projects/-/locations/-/agents/-/entityTypes/<System Entity Type ID> for system entity types (for example, projects/-/locations/-/agents/-/entityTypes/sys.date), or projects/<Project ID>/locations/<Location ID>/agents/<Agent ID>/entityTypes/<Entity Type ID> for developer entity types.
          required: true
        - name: 'isList'
          type: Boolean
          description: |
            Indicates whether the parameter represents a list of values.
        - name: 'redact'
          type: Boolean
          description: |
            Indicates whether the parameter content should be redacted in log. If redaction is enabled, the parameter content will be replaced by parameter name during logging.
            Note: the parameter content is subject to redaction if either parameter level redaction or entity type level redaction is enabled.
  - name: 'priority'
    type: Integer
    description: |
      The priority of this intent. Higher numbers represent higher priorities.
      If the supplied value is unspecified or 0, the service translates the value to 500,000, which corresponds to the Normal priority in the console.
      If the supplied value is negative, the intent is ignored in runtime detect intent requests.
  - name: 'isFallback'
    type: Boolean
    description: |
      Indicates whether this is a fallback intent. Currently only default fallback intent is allowed in the agent, which is added upon agent creation.
      Adding training phrases to fallback intent is useful in the case of requests that are mistakenly matched, since training phrases assigned to fallback intents act as negative examples that triggers no-match event.
      To manage the fallback intent, set `is_default_negative_intent = true`
  - name: 'labels'
    type: KeyValueLabels
    description: |
      The key/value metadata to label an intent. Labels can contain lowercase letters, digits and the symbols '-' and '_'. International characters are allowed, including letters from unicase alphabets. Keys must start with a letter. Keys and values can be no longer than 63 characters and no more than 128 bytes.
      Prefix "sys-" is reserved for Dialogflow defined labels. Currently allowed Dialogflow defined labels include: * sys-head * sys-contextual The above labels do not require value. "sys-head" means the intent is a head intent. "sys.contextual" means the intent is a contextual intent.
      An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.
  - name: 'description'
    type: String
    description: |
      Human readable description for better understanding an intent like its scope, content, result etc. Maximum character limit: 140 characters.
    validation:
      function: 'validation.StringLenBetween(0, 140)'
