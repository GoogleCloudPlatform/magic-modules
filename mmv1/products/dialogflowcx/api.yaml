          ~> **Note:** The first time you are deploying an Agent in your project you must configure location settings.
           This is a one time step but at the moment you can only [configure location settings](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#location-settings) via the Dialogflow CX console.
           Another options is to use global location so you don't need to manually configure location settings.
