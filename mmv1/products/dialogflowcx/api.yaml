      Agents are best described as Natural Language Understanding (NLU) modules that transform user requests into actionable data. You can include agents in your app, product, or service to determine user intent and respond to the user in a natural way.

          ~> **Note:** The first time you are deploying an Agent in your project you must configure location settings.
           This is a one time step but at the moment you can only [configure location settings](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#location-settings) via the Dialogflow CX console.
           Another options is to use global location so you don't need to manually configure location settings.

               Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts are concatenated.
               If the training phrase does not need to be annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the Part.text field set.
               If you want to annotate the training phrase, you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are populated in one of two ways:
               Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that has no parameters.
               Part.text is set to a part of the phrase that you want to annotate, and the parameterId field is set.

        description: |
          The priority of this intent. Higher numbers represent higher priorities.
          If the supplied value is unspecified or 0, the service translates the value to 500,000, which corresponds to the Normal priority in the console.
          If the supplied value is negative, the intent is ignored in runtime detect intent requests.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
        name: 'isFallback'
        description: |
          Indicates whether this is a fallback intent. Currently only default fallback intent is allowed in the agent, which is added upon agent creation. 
          Adding training phrases to fallback intent is useful in the case of requests that are mistakenly matched, since training phrases assigned to fallback intents act as negative examples that triggers no-match event.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::KeyValuePairs
        name: 'labels'
        description: |
          The key/value metadata to label an intent. Labels can contain lowercase letters, digits and the symbols '-' and '_'. International characters are allowed, including letters from unicase alphabets. Keys must start with a letter. Keys and values can be no longer than 63 characters and no more than 128 bytes.
          Prefix "sys-" is reserved for Dialogflow defined labels. Currently allowed Dialogflow defined labels include: * sys-head * sys-contextual The above labels do not require value. "sys-head" means the intent is a head intent. "sys.contextual" means the intent is a contextual intent.
          An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

      You can create multiple versions of your agent flows and deploy them to separate serving environments.
      When you edit a flow, you are editing a draft flow. At any point, you can save a draft flow as a flow version. A flow version is an immutable snapshot of your flow data and associated agent data like intents, entities, webhooks, pages, route groups, etc.

          ~> **Note:** The first time you are deploying an Agent in your project you must configure location settings.
           This is a one time step but at the moment you can only [configure location settings](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/region#location-settings) via the Dialogflow CX console.
           Another options is to use global location so you don't need to manually configure location settings.
