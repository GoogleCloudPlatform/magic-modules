  Bucket ACLs can be managed authoritatively using the
  [`storage_bucket_acl`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/storage_bucket_acl)
  resource. Do not use these two resources in conjunction to manage the same bucket.

  The BucketAccessControls resource manages the Access Control List
  (ACLs) for a single entity/role pairing on a bucket. ACLs let you specify who
  has access to your data and to what extent.

  There are three roles that can be assigned to an entity:

  READERs can get the bucket, though no acl property will be returned, and
  list the bucket's objects.  WRITERs are READERs, and they can insert
  objects into the bucket and delete the bucket's objects.  OWNERs are
  WRITERs, and they can get the acl property of a bucket, update a bucket,
  and call all BucketAccessControls methods on the bucket.  For more
  information, see Access Control, with the caveat that this API uses
  READER, WRITER, and OWNER instead of READ, WRITE, and FULL_CONTROL.
