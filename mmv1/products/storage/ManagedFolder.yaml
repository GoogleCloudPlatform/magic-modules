  A Google Cloud Storage Managed Folder.

  You can apply Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to
  managed folders to grant principals access only to the objects
  within the managed folder, which lets you more finely control access
  for specific data sets and tables within a bucket. You can nest
  managed folders up to 15 levels deep, including the parent managed
  folder.

  Managed folders can only be created in buckets that have uniform
  bucket-level access enabled.
