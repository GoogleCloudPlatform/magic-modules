  The DefaultObjectAccessControls resources represent the Access Control
  Lists (ACLs) applied to a new object within a Google Cloud Storage bucket
  when no ACL was provided for that object. ACLs let you specify who has
  access to your bucket contents and to what extent.

  There are two roles that can be assigned to an entity:

  READERs can get an object, though the acl property will not be revealed.
  OWNERs are READERs, and they can get the acl property, update an object,
  and call all objectAccessControls methods on the object. The owner of an
  object is always an OWNER.
  For more information, see Access Control, with the caveat that this API
  uses READER and OWNER instead of READ and FULL_CONTROL.
