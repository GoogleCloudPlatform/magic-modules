    Storage Intelligence Config is a singleton resource which cannot be created
    or deleted. A single instance of Storage Intelligence Config exist
    for each GCP Project. Terraform does not create or destroy this resource.
    Terraform resource creation for this resource is simply an update operation
    on existing resource with specified properties. Terraform deletion won't
    have any effect on this resource rather it will only remove it from the
    state file.
