  A Google Cloud Firebase instance. This enables Firebase resources on a given google project.
  Since a FirebaseProject is actually also a GCP Project, a FirebaseProject uses underlying GCP
  identifiers (most importantly, the projectId) as its own for easy interop with GCP APIs.
  Once Firebase has been added to a Google Project it cannot be removed.
