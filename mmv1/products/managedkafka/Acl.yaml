  - name: 'aclId'
    type: String
    description: "The ID to use for the acl, which will become the final
      component of the acl's name. The structure of `aclId` defines the Resource Pattern (resource_type,
      resource_name, pattern_type) of the acl. `aclId` is structured like one of the following:

      For acls on the cluster:
        `cluster`

      For acls on a single resource within the cluster:
        `topic/{resource_name}`
        `consumerGroup/{resource_name}`
        `transactionalId/{resource_name}`

      For acls on all resources that match a prefix:
        `topicPrefixed/{resource_name}`
        `consumerGroupPrefixed/{resource_name}`
        `transactionalIdPrefixed/{resource_name}`

      For acls on all resources of a given type (i.e. the wildcard literal '*''):
        `allTopics` (represents `topic/*`)
        `allConsumerGroups` (represents `consumerGroup/*`)
        `allTransactionalIds` (represents `transactionalId/*`)."

  - name: 'etag'
    type: Fingerprint
    output: true
    description: |
      `etag` is used for concurrency control. An `etag` is returned in the
      response to `GetAcl` and `CreateAcl`. Callers are required to put that etag
      in the request to `UpdateAcl` to ensure that their change will be applied
      to the same version of the acl that exists in the Kafka Cluster.

      A terminal 'T' character in the etag indicates that the AclEntries were
      truncated due to repeated field limits.
