  A collection of resources that are deployed and managed together using
  a configuration file
docs:
  warning: |
    Deployment Manager shares similar behavior with Terraform as both
    products manage GCP resource lifecycle and state. This Terraform
    resource is intended only to manage a Deployment resource,
    and attempts to manage the Deployment's resources in Terraform as well
    will likely result in errors or unexpected behavior as the two tools
    fight over ownership. We strongly discourage doing so unless you are an
    experienced user of both tools.

    In addition, due to limitations of the API, Terraform will treat
    deployments in preview as recreate-only for any update operation other
    than actually deploying an in-preview deployment (i.e. `preview=true` to
    `preview=false`).

      Set the policy to use for creating new resources. Only used on
      create and update. Valid values are `CREATE_OR_ACQUIRE` (default) or
      `ACQUIRE`. If set to `ACQUIRE` and resources do not already exist,
      the deployment will fail. Note that updating this field does not
      actually affect the deployment, just how it is updated.

    description: |
      Set the policy to use for deleting new resources on update/delete.
      Valid values are `DELETE` (default) or `ABANDON`. If `DELETE`,
      resource is deleted after removal from Deployment Manager. If
      `ABANDON`, the resource is only removed from Deployment Manager
      and is not actually deleted. Note that updating this field does not
      actually change the deployment, just how it is updated.

    type: Boolean
    description: |
      If set to true, a deployment is created with "shell" resources
      that are not actually instantiated. This allows you to preview a
      deployment. It can be updated to false to actually deploy
      with real resources.
       ~>**NOTE:** Deployment Manager does not allow update
      of a deployment in preview (unless updating to preview=false). Thus,
      Terraform will force-recreate deployments if either preview is updated
      to true or if other fields are updated while preview is true.
