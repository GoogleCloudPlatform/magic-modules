    type: Boolean
    description: |
      If the field is true, that indicates that there is some configuration issue with the active_key_version
      configured on this Folder (e.g. it doesn't exist or the Access Approval service account doesn't have the
      correct permissions on it, etc.) This key version is not necessarily the effective key version at this level,
      as key versions are inherited top-down.
