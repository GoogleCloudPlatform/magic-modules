  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
    name: enrolledAncestor
    output: true
    description: |
      If the field is true, that indicates that at least one service is enrolled for Access Approval in one or more ancestors of the Folder.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: activeKeyVersion
    description: |
      The asymmetric crypto key version to use for signing approval requests.
      Empty active_key_version indicates that a Google-managed key should be used for signing.
      This property will be ignored if set by an ancestor of the resource, and new non-empty values may not be set.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
    name: ancestorHasActiveKeyVersion
    output: true
    description: |
      If the field is true, that indicates that an ancestor of this Folder has set active_key_version.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
    name: invalidKeyVersion
    output: true
    description: |
      If the field is true, that indicates that there is some configuration issue with the active_key_version
      configured on this Folder (e.g. it doesn't exist or the Access Approval service account doesn't have the
      correct permissions on it, etc.) This key version is not necessarily the effective key version at this level,
      as key versions are inherited top-down.
