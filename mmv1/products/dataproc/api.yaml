            default_value: 1
            description: |
              Weight for the instance group, which is used to determine the fraction of total workers
              in the cluster from this instance group. For example, if primary workers have weight 2,
              and secondary workers have weight 1, the cluster will have approximately 2 primary workers
              for each secondary worker.

              The cluster may not reach the specified balance if constrained by min/max bounds or other
              autoscaling settings. For example, if maxInstances for secondary workers is 0, then only
              primary workers will be added. The cluster can also be out of balance when created.

              If weight is not set on any instance group, the cluster will default to equal weight for
              all groups: the cluster will attempt to maintain an equal number of workers in each group
              within the configured size bounds for each group. If weight is set for one group only,
              the cluster will default to zero weight on the unset group. For example if weight is set
              only on primary workers, the cluster will use primary workers only and no secondary workers.

                  Fraction of average pending memory in the last cooldown period for which to

                  must recommend at least a 2-worker scale-up for the cluster to scale. A threshold of
                  0 means the autoscaler will scale up on any recommended change.
