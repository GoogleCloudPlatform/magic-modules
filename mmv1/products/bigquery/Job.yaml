    Jobs are actions that BigQuery runs on your behalf to load data, export data, query data, or copy data.
    Once a BigQuery job is created, it cannot be changed or deleted.

                To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts
                the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the
                data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence "\t" to specify a tab separator.
                The default value is a comma (',').

                The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data.
                The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.
                When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following:
                skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected,
                the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row.
                skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row.
                skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected,
                row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.
