  Gives dataset access for a single entity. This resource is intended to be used in cases where
  it is not possible to compile a full list of access blocks to include in a
  `google_bigquery_dataset` resource, to enable them to be added separately.

  ~> **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `google_bigquery_dataset` resource, the
  dataset resource must either have no defined `access` blocks or a `lifecycle` block with
  `ignore_changes = [access]` so they don't fight over which accesses should be on the dataset.
  Additionally, both resource cannot be modified in the same apply.

      Describes the rights granted to the user specified by the other
      member of the access object. Basic, predefined, and custom roles are
      supported. Predefined roles that have equivalent basic roles are
      swapped by the API to their basic counterparts, and will show a diff
      post-create. See
      [official docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control).
