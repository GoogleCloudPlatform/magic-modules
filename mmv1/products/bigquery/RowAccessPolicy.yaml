    type: String
    description: |-
      A SQL boolean expression that represents the rows defined by this row
      access policy, similar to the boolean expression in a WHERE clause of a
      SELECT query on a table.
      References to other tables, routines, and temporary functions are not
      supported.

      Examples: region="EU"
      date_field = CAST('2019-9-27' as DATE)
      nullable_field is not NULL
      numeric_field BETWEEN 1.0 AND 5.0

    type: Array
    description: |-
      Input only. The optional list of iam_member users or groups that specifies the initial
      members that the row-level access policy should be created with.

      grantees types:
      - "user:alice@example.com": An email address that represents a specific
      Google account.
      - "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com": An email
      address that represents a service account.
      - "group:admins@example.com": An email address that represents a Google
      group.
      - "domain:example.com":The Google Workspace domain (primary) that
      represents all the users of that domain.
      - "allAuthenticatedUsers": A special identifier that represents all service
      accounts and all users on the internet who have authenticated with a Google
      Account. This identifier includes accounts that aren't connected to a
      Google Workspace or Cloud Identity domain, such as personal Gmail accounts.
      Users who aren't authenticated, such as anonymous visitors, aren't
      included.
      - "allUsers":A special identifier that represents anyone who is on
      the internet, including authenticated and unauthenticated users. Because
      BigQuery requires authentication before a user can access the service,
      allUsers includes only authenticated users.
