    You must specify the role field using the legacy format `OWNER` instead of `roles/bigquery.dataOwner`.
    The API does accept both formats but it will always return the legacy format which results in Terraform
    showing permanent diff on each plan and apply operation.

    type: Integer
    description: |
      The default lifetime of all tables in the dataset, in milliseconds.
      The minimum value is 3600000 milliseconds (one hour).
      Once this property is set, all newly-created tables in the dataset
      will have an `expirationTime` property set to the creation time plus
      the value in this property, and changing the value will only affect
      new tables, not existing ones. When the `expirationTime` for a given
      table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically.
      If a table's `expirationTime` is modified or removed before the
      table expires, or if you provide an explicit `expirationTime` when
      creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default
      expiration time indicated by this property.
    validation:
      function: 'validateDefaultTableExpirationMs'
  - name: 'defaultPartitionExpirationMs'
    type: Integer
    description: |
      The default partition expiration for all partitioned tables in
      the dataset, in milliseconds.
      Once this property is set, all newly-created partitioned tables in
      the dataset will have an `expirationMs` property in the `timePartitioning`
      settings set to this value, and changing the value will only
      affect new tables, not existing ones. The storage in a partition will
      have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.
      Setting this property overrides the use of `defaultTableExpirationMs`
      for partitioned tables: only one of `defaultTableExpirationMs` and
      `defaultPartitionExpirationMs` will be used for any new partitioned
      table. If you provide an explicit `timePartitioning.expirationMs` when
      creating or updating a partitioned table, that value takes precedence
      over the default partition expiration time indicated by this property.

      The geographic location where the dataset should reside.
      See [official docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/dataset-locations).
      There are two types of locations, regional or multi-regional. A regional
      location is a specific geographic place, such as Tokyo, and a multi-regional
      location is a large geographic area, such as the United States, that
      contains at least two geographic places.
      The default value is multi-regional location `US`.
      Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

        description: |
          Describes the Cloud KMS encryption key that will be used to protect destination

  - name: 'isCaseInsensitive'
    type: Boolean
    description: |
      TRUE if the dataset and its table names are case-insensitive, otherwise FALSE.

      case-sensitive. This field does not affect routine references.
    default_from_api: true
  - name: 'defaultCollation'
    type: String
    description: |
      Defines the default collation specification of future tables created
      in the dataset. If a table is created in this dataset without table-level
      default collation, then the table inherits the dataset default collation,
      which is applied to the string fields that do not have explicit collation
      specified. A change to this field affects only tables created afterwards,
      and does not alter the existing tables.

      The following values are supported:
      - 'und:ci': undetermined locale, case insensitive.
      - '': empty string. Default to case-sensitive behavior.
    default_from_api: true
  - name: 'storageBillingModel'
    type: String
    description: |
      Specifies the storage billing model for the dataset.
      Set this flag value to LOGICAL to use logical bytes for storage billing,
      or to PHYSICAL to use physical bytes instead.

      LOGICAL is the default if this flag isn't specified.
    default_from_api: true
  - name: 'resourceTags'
    type: KeyValuePairs
    description: |
      The tags attached to this table. Tag keys are globally unique. Tag key is expected to be
      in the namespaced format, for example "123456789012/environment" where 123456789012 is the
      ID of the parent organization or project resource for this tag key. Tag value is expected
      to be the short name, for example "Production". See [Tag definitions](/iam/docs/tags-access-control#definitions)
      for more details.
