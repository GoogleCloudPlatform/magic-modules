          The minimum value is 3600000 milliseconds (one hour).


          Once this property is set, all newly-created tables in the dataset
          will have an `expirationTime` property set to the creation time plus
          the value in this property, and changing the value will only affect
          new tables, not existing ones. When the `expirationTime` for a given
          table is reached, that table will be deleted automatically.
          If a table's `expirationTime` is modified or removed before the
          table expires, or if you provide an explicit `expirationTime` when
          creating a table, that value takes precedence over the default
          expiration time indicated by this property.

          Once this property is set, all newly-created partitioned tables in
          the dataset will have an `expirationMs` property in the `timePartitioning`
          settings set to this value, and changing the value will only
          affect new tables, not existing ones. The storage in a partition will
          have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.
          Setting this property overrides the use of `defaultTableExpirationMs`
          for partitioned tables: only one of `defaultTableExpirationMs` and
          `defaultPartitionExpirationMs` will be used for any new partitioned
          table. If you provide an explicit `timePartitioning.expirationMs` when
          creating or updating a partitioned table, that value takes precedence
          over the default partition expiration time indicated by this property.

          contains at least two geographic places.

      `google_bigquery_dataset` resource, to enable them to be added separately.

      ~> **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `google_bigquery_dataset` resource, the

                  empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as

                  To use a character in the range 128-255, you must encode the character as UTF8. BigQuery converts
                  the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the
                  data in its raw, binary state. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence "\t" to specify a tab separator.

                  The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped.
                  When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following:
                  skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the first row. If they are not detected,
                  the row is read as data. Otherwise data is read starting from the second row.
                  skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and data should be read starting from the first row.
                  skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect headers in row N. If headers are not detected,
                  row N is just skipped. Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.

                  The default value is a double-quote ('"'). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string.

          A JSON schema for the return type. Optional if language = "SQL"; required otherwise.
          If absent, the return type is inferred from definitionBody at query time in each query
          that references this routine. If present, then the evaluated result will be cast to
          the specified returned type at query time. ~>**NOTE**: Because this field expects a JSON
          string, any changes to the string will create a diff, even if the JSON itself hasn't
          changed. If the API returns a different value for the same schema, e.g. it switche
          d the order of values or replaced STRUCT field type with RECORD field type, we currently
          cannot suppress the recurring diff this causes. As a workaround, we recommend using
          the schema as returned by the API.

          Optional. Can be set only if routineType = "TABLE_VALUED_FUNCTION".

          If absent, the return table type is inferred from definitionBody at query time in each query
          that references this routine. If present, then the columns in the evaluated table result will
          be cast to match the column types specificed in return table type, at query time.

          Optional. If language = "JAVASCRIPT", this field stores the path of the
          imported JAVASCRIPT libraries.
