      The ID to use for the pool, which becomes the final component of the resource name. This
      value should be 4-32 characters, and may contain the characters [a-z0-9-]. The prefix
      `gcp-` is reserved for use by Google, and may not be specified.

    description: |
      The state of the pool.
      * STATE_UNSPECIFIED: State unspecified.
      * ACTIVE: The pool is active, and may be used in Google Cloud policies.
      * DELETED: The pool is soft-deleted. Soft-deleted pools are permanently deleted after
        approximately 30 days. You can restore a soft-deleted pool using
        UndeleteWorkloadIdentityPool. You cannot reuse the ID of a soft-deleted pool until it is
        permanently deleted. While a pool is deleted, you cannot use it to exchange tokens, or
        use existing tokens to access resources. If the pool is undeleted, existing tokens grant
        access again.

  - name: 'disabled'
    type: Boolean
    description: |
      Whether the pool is disabled. You cannot use a disabled pool to exchange tokens, or use
      existing tokens to access resources. If the pool is re-enabled, existing tokens grant
      access again.
