      A list of notification configs. Each configuration uses a filter to determine whether to publish a

            It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message
            was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. Topic names must be scoped to a

            Cloud Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions will cause the calls that send notifications to fail.

          description: |
            Restricts notifications sent for messages matching a filter. If this is empty, all messages
            are matched. Syntax: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/search/query_strings

            Fields/functions available for filtering are:

            * messageType, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, NOT messageType = "ADT".
            * send_date or sendDate, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset's timeZone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, send_date < "2017-01-02".
            * sendTime, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, sendTime < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00".
            * sendFacility, the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, sendFacility = "ABC".
            * PatientId(value, type), which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, PatientId("123456", "MRN").
            * labels.x, a string value of the label with key x as set using the Message.labels map. For example, labels."priority"="high". The operator :* can be used to assert the existence of a label. For example, labels."priority":*.
