    name: 'enableUpdateCreate'
    description: |
      Whether this FHIR store has the updateCreate capability. This determines if the client can use an Update
      operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through
      the Create operation and attempts to Update a non-existent resource will return errors. Please treat the audit
      logs with appropriate levels of care if client-specified resource IDs contain sensitive data such as patient
      identifiers, those IDs will be part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Cloud Pub/Sub
      notifications.
    required: false
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
    name: 'disableReferentialIntegrity'
    description: |
      Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store
      creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API will enforce referential integrity and fail the
      requests that will result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API
      will skip referential integrity check. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as
      Patient.get$everything, will not return all the results if broken references exist.

      ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) **
    required: false
    immutable: true
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
    name: 'disableResourceVersioning'
    description: |
      Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation
      of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations will cause historical
      versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but
      cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions will be kept. The server will send back errors for
      attempts to read the historical versions.

      ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) **
    required: false
    immutable: true
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
    name: 'enableHistoryImport'
    description: |
      Whether to allow the bulk import API to accept history bundles and directly insert historical resource
      versions into the FHIR store. Importing resource histories creates resource interactions that appear to have
      occurred in the past, which clients may not want to allow. If set to false, history bundles within an import
      will fail with an error.

      ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) **

      ** This property can be changed manually in the Google Cloud Healthcare admin console without recreating the FHIR store **

      A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in
      this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next
      resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed
      from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required
      bigquery.dataEditor role to your project's Cloud Healthcare Service Agent service account. Some lag (typically on
      the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination.

            The destination BigQuery structure that contains both the dataset location and corresponding schema config.
            The output is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the existing tables (if any) that
            are named after the resource types, e.g. "Patient", "Observation". When there is no existing table for a given
            resource type, the server attempts to create one.
            See the [streaming config reference](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.datasets.fhirStores#streamconfig) for more details.

            Note that setting this to true does not guarantee that all resources will be sent in the format of
            full FHIR resource. When a resource change is too large or during heavy traffic, only the resource name will be
            sent. Clients should always check the "payloadType" label from a Pub/Sub message to determine whether
            it needs to fetch the full resource as a separate operation.
