  - name: 'labels'
    type: KeyValueLabels
    description: |
      User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize DICOM stores.

      Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must
      conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}][\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,62}

      Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128
      bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63}

      No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store.

      An object containing a list of "key": value pairs.
      Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.

          It is guaranteed to be unique within the topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message
          was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty. Topic names must be scoped to a
          project. service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-healthcare.iam.gserviceaccount.com must have publisher permissions on the given
          Cloud Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions will cause the calls that send notifications to fail.
