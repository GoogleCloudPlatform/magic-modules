      User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize DICOM stores.

      Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must
      conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}][\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,62}

      Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128
      bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\p{Ll}\p{Lo}\p{N}_-]{0,63}

          project. service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-healthcare.iam.gserviceaccount.com must have publisher permissions on the given
          Cloud Pub/Sub topic. Not having adequate permissions will cause the calls that send notifications to fail.
