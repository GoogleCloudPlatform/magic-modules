    description: |
      A domain which is being authorized. A DnsAuthorization resource covers a

    type: Enum
    description: |
      type of DNS authorization. If unset during the resource creation, FIXED_RECORD will
      be used for global resources, and PER_PROJECT_RECORD will be used for other locations.

      FIXED_RECORD DNS authorization uses DNS-01 validation method

      PER_PROJECT_RECORD DNS authorization allows for independent management
      of Google-managed certificates with DNS authorization across multiple
      projects.
