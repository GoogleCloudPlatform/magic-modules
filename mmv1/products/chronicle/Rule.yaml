    description: |
      Policy to determine if the rule should be deleted forcefully.
      If deletion_policy = "FORCE", any retrohunts and any detections associated with the rule
      will also be deleted. If deletion_policy = "DEFAULT", the call will only succeed if the
      rule has no associated retrohunts, including completed retrohunts, and no
      associated detections. Regardless of this field's value, the rule
      deployment associated with this rule will also be deleted.
