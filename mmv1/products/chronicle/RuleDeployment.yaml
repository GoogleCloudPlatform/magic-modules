parameters:
  - name: location
    type: String
    description: The location of the resource. This is the geographical region where the Chronicle instance resides, such as "us" or "europe-west2".
    immutable: true
    url_param_only: true
    required: true
  - name: instance
    type: String
    description: The unique identifier for the Chronicle instance, which is the same as the customer ID.
    immutable: true
    url_param_only: true
    required: true
  - name: rule
    type: String
    description: The Rule ID of the rule.
    immutable: true
    url_param_only: true
    required: true
properties:
  - name: name
    type: String
    description: |-
      The resource name of the rule deployment.
      Note that RuleDeployment is a child of the overall Rule, not any individual
      revision, so the resource ID segment for the Rule resource must not
      reference a specific revision.
      Format:
      projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance}/rules/{rule}/deployment
    output: true
  - name: enabled
    type: Boolean
    description: Whether the rule is currently deployed continuously against incoming data.
  - name: alerting
    type: Boolean
    description: |-
      Whether detections resulting from this deployment should be considered
      alerts.
  - name: archived
    type: Boolean
    description: |-
      The archive state of the rule deployment.
      Cannot be set to true unless enabled is set to false i.e.
      archiving requires a two-step process: first, disable the rule by
      setting 'enabled' to false, then set 'archive' to true.
      If set to true, alerting will automatically be set to false.
      If currently set to true, enabled, alerting, and run_frequency cannot be
      updated.
  - name: archiveTime
    type: String
    description: Output only. The timestamp when the rule deployment archive state was last set to true.
      If the rule deployment's current archive state is not set to true, the field will be empty.
    output: true
  - name: runFrequency
    type: String
    diff_suppress_func: 'chronicleRuleDeploymentNilRunFrequencyDiffSuppressFunc'
    description: |2-

      The run frequency of the rule deployment.
      Possible values:
      LIVE
      HOURLY
      DAILY
  - name: executionState
    type: String
    description: |2-

      The execution state of the rule deployment.
      Possible values:
      DEFAULT
      LIMITED
      PAUSED
    output: true
  - name: producerRules
    type: Array
    description: |2-
      Output only. The names of the associated/chained producer rules. Rules are considered
      producers for this rule if this rule explicitly filters on their ruleid.
      Format:
      projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance}/rules/{rule}
    output: true
    item_type:
      type: String
  - name: consumerRules
    type: Array
    description: |2-
      Output only. The names of the associated/chained consumer rules. Rules are considered
      consumers of this rule if their rule text explicitly filters on this rule's ruleid.
      Format:
      projects/{project}/locations/{location}/instances/{instance}/rules/{rule}
    output: true
    item_type:
      type: String
  - name: lastAlertStatusChangeTime
    type: String
    description: Output only. The timestamp when the rule deployment alert state was lastly changed.
      This is filled regardless of the current alert state.E.g. if the current alert status is false,
      this timestamp will be the timestamp when the alert status was changed to false.
    output: true
