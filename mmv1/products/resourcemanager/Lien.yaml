# This resource has some issues - it returns a list when you query for it.
# You can't use the same URL for GET and DELETE.  This here is the URL that
# we use for GET, and the DELETE is in custom code.  If this happens a lot,
# we might build a more general solution, but this is the only resource I know
# of where that happens.

    description: |
      A reference to the resource this Lien is attached to.
      The server will validate the parent against those for which Liens are supported.
      Since a variety of objects can have Liens against them, you must provide the type
      prefix (e.g. "projects/my-project-name").
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Array

      The types of operations which should be blocked as a result of this Lien.
      Each value should correspond to an IAM permission. The server will validate
      the permissions against those for which Liens are supported.  An empty
      list is meaningless and will be rejected.
      e.g. ['resourcemanager.projects.delete']
