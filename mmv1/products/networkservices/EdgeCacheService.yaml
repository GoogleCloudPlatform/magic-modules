      HTTP/2 (h2) is enabled by default and recommended for performance. HTTP/2 improves connection re-use and reduces connection setup overhead by sending multiple streams over the same connection.

      Some legacy HTTP clients may have issues with HTTP/2 connections due to broken HTTP/2 implementations. Setting this to true will prevent HTTP/2 from being advertised and negotiated.

              description: |
                The list of host patterns to match.

                Host patterns must be valid hostnames. Ports are not allowed. Wildcard hosts are supported in the suffix or prefix form. * matches any string of ([a-z0-9-.]*). It does not match the empty string.

                When multiple hosts are specified, hosts are matched in the following priority:

                  1. Exact domain names: ``www.foo.com``.
                  2. Suffix domain wildcards: ``*.foo.com`` or ``*-bar.foo.com``.
                  3. Prefix domain wildcards: ``foo.*`` or ``foo-*``.
                  4. Special wildcard ``*`` matching any domain.

                  Notes:

                    The wildcard will not match the empty string. e.g. ``*-bar.foo.com`` will match ``baz-bar.foo.com`` but not ``-bar.foo.com``. The longest wildcards match first. Only a single host in the entire service can match on ``*``. A domain must be unique across all configured hosts within a service.

                    Hosts are matched against the HTTP Host header, or for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the ":authority" header, from the incoming request.

                    You may specify up to 10 hosts.

                      Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers
                      to which you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on existing rules.
