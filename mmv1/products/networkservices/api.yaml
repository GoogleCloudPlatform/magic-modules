          retryConditions and failoverOrigin to control its own cache fill failures.

          The total number of allowed attempts to cache fill across this and failover origins is limited to four.
          The total time allowed for cache fill attempts across this and failover origins can be controlled with maxAttemptsTimeout.

          The last valid, non-retried response from all origins will be returned to the client.
          If no origin returns a valid response, an HTTP 502 will be returned to the client.

        name: 'retryConditions' # default CONNECT_FAILURE from api
        description: |
          Specifies one or more retry conditions for the configured origin.

          If the failure mode during a connection attempt to the origin matches the configured retryCondition(s),
          the origin request will be retried up to maxAttempts times. The failoverOrigin, if configured, will then be used to satisfy the request.

          The default retryCondition is "CONNECT_FAILURE".

          retryConditions apply to this origin, and not subsequent failoverOrigin(s),
          which may specify their own retryConditions and maxAttempts.

          Valid values are:

          - CONNECT_FAILURE: Retry on failures connecting to origins, for example due to connection timeouts.
          - HTTP_5XX: Retry if the origin responds with any 5xx response code, or if the origin does not respond at all, example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and refused streams.
          - GATEWAY_ERROR: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes 502, 503 or 504.
          - RETRIABLE_4XX: Retry for retriable 4xx response codes, which include HTTP 409 (Conflict) and HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)
          - NOT_FOUND: Retry if the origin returns a HTTP 404 (Not Found). This can be useful when generating video content, and the segment is not available yet.
          - FORBIDDEN: Retry if the origin returns a HTTP 403 (Forbidden).

              The connectTimeout capped by the deadline set by the request's maxAttemptsTimeout.  The last connection attempt may have a smaller connectTimeout in order to adhere to the overall maxAttemptsTimeout.

              The responseTimeout starts after the connection has been established.

              This also applies to HTTP Chunked Transfer Encoding responses, and/or when an open-ended Range request is made to the origin. Origins that take longer to write additional bytes to the response than the configured responseTimeout will result in an error being returned to the client.

                    The list of host patterns to match.
  
                    Host patterns must be valid hostnames. Ports are not allowed. Wildcard hosts are supported in the suffix or prefix form. * matches any string of ([a-z0-9-.]*). It does not match the empty string.
  
                    When multiple hosts are specified, hosts are matched in the following priority:
  
                      1. Exact domain names: ``www.foo.com``.
                      2. Suffix domain wildcards: ``*.foo.com`` or ``*-bar.foo.com``.
                      3. Prefix domain wildcards: ``foo.*`` or ``foo-*``.
                      4. Special wildcard ``*`` matching any domain.
  
                      Notes:
  
                        The wildcard will not match the empty string. e.g. ``*-bar.foo.com`` will match ``baz-bar.foo.com`` but not ``-bar.foo.com``. The longest wildcards match first. Only a single host in the entire service can match on ``*``. A domain must be unique across all configured hosts within a service.

                        Hosts are matched against the HTTP Host header, or for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the ":authority" header, from the incoming request.
  
                        You may specify up to 10 hosts.

                                  Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency.

                                  By default, the CDNPolicy will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes:

                                  - HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m

                                  These defaults can be overridden in negativeCachingPolicy
