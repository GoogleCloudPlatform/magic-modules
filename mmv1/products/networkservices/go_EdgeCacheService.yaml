      Disables HTTP/2.

      HTTP/2 (h2) is enabled by default and recommended for performance. HTTP/2 improves connection re-use and reduces connection setup overhead by sending multiple streams over the same connection.

      Some legacy HTTP clients may have issues with HTTP/2 connections due to broken HTTP/2 implementations. Setting this to true will prevent HTTP/2 from being advertised and negotiated.

              type: Array
              description: |
                The list of host patterns to match.

                Host patterns must be valid hostnames. Ports are not allowed. Wildcard hosts are supported in the suffix or prefix form. * matches any string of ([a-z0-9-.]*). It does not match the empty string.

                When multiple hosts are specified, hosts are matched in the following priority:

                  1. Exact domain names: ``www.foo.com``.
                  2. Suffix domain wildcards: ``*.foo.com`` or ``*-bar.foo.com``.
                  3. Prefix domain wildcards: ``foo.*`` or ``foo-*``.
                  4. Special wildcard ``*`` matching any domain.

                  Notes:

                    The wildcard will not match the empty string. e.g. ``*-bar.foo.com`` will match ``baz-bar.foo.com`` but not ``-bar.foo.com``. The longest wildcards match first. Only a single host in the entire service can match on ``*``. A domain must be unique across all configured hosts within a service.

                    Hosts are matched against the HTTP Host header, or for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the ":authority" header, from the incoming request.

                    You may specify up to 10 hosts.

                      Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers
                      to which you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on existing rules.

                              Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by reducing response latency.

                              By default, the CDNPolicy will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes:

                              - HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m
                              - HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s
                              - HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 414 (URI Too Long), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s

                              These defaults can be overridden in negativeCachingPolicy
