    type: KeyValueLabels
    description: |
      Set of labels associated with the AuthzExtension resource.
  - name: 'loadBalancingScheme'
    type: Enum
    description: |
      All backend services and forwarding rules referenced by this extension must share the same load balancing scheme.
      For more information, refer to [Backend services overview](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service).
    required: true
    enum_values:
      - 'INTERNAL_MANAGED'
      - 'EXTERNAL_MANAGED'
  - name: 'authority'
    type: String
    description: |
      The :authority header in the gRPC request sent from Envoy to the extension service.
    required: true
  - name: 'service'
    type: ResourceRef
    description: |
      The reference to the service that runs the extension.
      To configure a callout extension, service must be a fully-qualified reference to a [backend service](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/backendServices) in the format:
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/regions/{region}/backendServices/{backendService} or https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/backendServices/{backendService}.

    resource: 'BackendService'
    imports: 'selfLink'
  - name: 'timeout'
    type: String
    description: |
      Specifies the timeout for each individual message on the stream. The timeout must be between 10-10000 milliseconds.
    required: true
    diff_suppress_func: 'tpgresource.DurationDiffSuppress'
  - name: 'failOpen'
    type: Boolean
    description: |
      Determines how the proxy behaves if the call to the extension fails or times out.
      When set to TRUE, request or response processing continues without error. Any subsequent extensions in the extension chain are also executed. When set to FALSE or the default setting of FALSE is used, one of the following happens:
      * If response headers have not been delivered to the downstream client, a generic 500 error is returned to the client. The error response can be tailored by configuring a custom error response in the load balancer.
      * If response headers have been delivered, then the HTTP stream to the downstream client is reset.

  - name: 'forwardHeaders'
    type: Array
    description: |
      List of the HTTP headers to forward to the extension (from the client). If omitted, all headers are sent. Each element is a string indicating the header name.
    item_type:
      type: String
  - name: 'wireFormat'
    type: Enum
