      Optional. If set to a valid TCP port (1-65535), instructs the SIDECAR proxy to listen on the
      specified port of localhost (127.0.0.1) address. The SIDECAR proxy will expect all traffic to
      be redirected to this port regardless of its actual ip:port destination. If unset, a port
      '15001' is used as the interception port. This will is applicable only for sidecar proxy
      deployments.
