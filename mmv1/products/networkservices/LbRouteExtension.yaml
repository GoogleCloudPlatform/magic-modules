                   Any subsequent extensions in the extension chain are also executed.
                   When set to FALSE: * If response headers have not been delivered to the downstream client,
                   a generic 500 error is returned to the client. The error response can be tailored by
                   configuring a custom error response in the load balancer.

                description: |
                  A set of events during request or response processing for which this extension is called.
                  This field is optional for the LbRouteExtension resource. If unspecified, `REQUEST_HEADERS` event is assumed as supported.
                  Possible values: `REQUEST_HEADERS`, `REQUEST_BODY`, `REQUEST_TRAILERS`.

                  The metadata provided here is included as part of the `metadata_context` (of type `google.protobuf.Struct`)
                  in the `ProcessingRequest` message sent to the extension server.
                  The metadata is available under the namespace `com.google.lb_route_extension.<resource_name>.<chain_name>.<extension_name>`.
                  The following variables are supported in the metadata: `{forwarding_rule_id}` - substituted with the forwarding rule's fully qualified resource name.
                  This field must not be set for plugin extensions. Setting it results in a validation error.
              - name: 'requestBodySendMode'
                type: Enum
                description: |
                  Configures the send mode for request body processing.
                  The field can only be set if `supported_events` includes `REQUEST_BODY`.
                  If `supported_events` includes `REQUEST_BODY`, but `request_body_send_mode` is unset, the default value `STREAMED` is used.
                  When this field is set to `FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED`, `supported_events` must include both `REQUEST_BODY` and `REQUEST_TRAILERS`.
                  This field can be set only when the `service` field of the extension points to a `BackendService`.
                  Only `FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED` mode is supported for `LbRouteExtension` resources.
                enum_values:

              - name: 'observabilityMode'
                type: Boolean
                description: |
                  When set to `TRUE`, enables `observability_mode` on the `ext_proc` filter.
                  This makes `ext_proc` calls asynchronous. Envoy doesn't check for the response from `ext_proc` calls.
                  For more information about the filter, see: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.32.3/api-v3/extensions/filters/http/ext_proc/v3/ext_proc.proto
                  This field is helpful when you want to try out the extension in async log-only mode.
                  Supported by regional `LbTrafficExtension` and `LbRouteExtension` resources.
                  Only `STREAMED` (default) body processing mode is supported.
  - name: 'loadBalancingScheme'
    type: Enum
    description: |
      All backend services and forwarding rules referenced by this extension must share the same load balancing scheme.
