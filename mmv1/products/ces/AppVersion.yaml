          In Customer Engagement Suite (CES), an app serves as a top-level container
          for a group of agents, including the root agent and its sub-agents, along
          with their associated configurations. These agents work together to achieve
          specific goals within the app's context.

                              HTTPS verification. This overrides the default SSL trust store. If this

                              certificates are signed with "subject alt name". For instance a
                              certificate can be self-signed using the following command,
                              openssl x509 -req -days 200 -in example.com.csr \
