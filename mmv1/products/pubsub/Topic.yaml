      The resource name of the Cloud KMS CryptoKey to be used to protect access
      to messages published on this topic. Your project's PubSub service account
      (`service-{{PROJECT_NUMBER}}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) must have

      Policy constraining the set of Google Cloud Platform regions where
      messages published to the topic may be stored. If not present, then no
      constraints are in effect.

        description: |
          A list of IDs of GCP regions where messages that are published to
          the topic may be persisted in storage. Messages published by
          publishers running in non-allowed GCP regions (or running outside
          of GCP altogether) will be routed for storage in one of the
          allowed regions. An empty list means that no regions are allowed,
          and is not a valid configuration.

    name: 'messageRetentionDuration'
    description: |
      Indicates the minimum duration to retain a message after it is published
      to the topic. If this field is set, messages published to the topic in
      the last messageRetentionDuration are always available to subscribers.
      For instance, it allows any attached subscription to seek to a timestamp
      that is up to messageRetentionDuration in the past. If this field is not
      set, message retention is controlled by settings on individual subscriptions.
      Cannot be more than 31 days or less than 10 minutes.
