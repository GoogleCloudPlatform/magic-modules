        description: |
          A list of IDs of GCP regions where messages that are published to
          the topic may be persisted in storage. Messages published by
          publishers running in non-allowed GCP regions (or running outside
          of GCP altogether) will be routed for storage in one of the
          allowed regions. An empty list means that no regions are allowed,
          and is not a valid configuration.

        description: |
          The name of the schema that messages published should be
          validated against. Format is projects/{project}/schemas/{schema}.

  - name: 'messageRetentionDuration'
    type: String
    description: |
      Indicates the minimum duration to retain a message after it is published
      to the topic. If this field is set, messages published to the topic in
      the last messageRetentionDuration are always available to subscribers.
      For instance, it allows any attached subscription to seek to a timestamp
      that is up to messageRetentionDuration in the past. If this field is not
      set, message retention is controlled by settings on individual subscriptions.
      The rotation period has the format of a decimal number, followed by the
      letter `s` (seconds). Cannot be more than 31 days or less than 10 minutes.
