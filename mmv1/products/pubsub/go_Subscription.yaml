      - name: 'attributes'
        type: KeyValuePairs
        description: |
          Endpoint configuration attributes.

          Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can
          be used to control different aspects of the message delivery.

          The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you
          can use to change the format of the pushed message. This
          attribute indicates the version of the data expected by
          the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message
          (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
          based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.

          If not present during the subscriptions.create call,
          it will default to the version of the API used to make
          such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig
          call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get
          calls will always return a valid version, even if the
          subscription was created without this attribute.

          The possible values for this attribute are:

          - v1beta1: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.
          - v1 or v1beta2: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.
        diff_suppress_func: 'tpgresource.IgnoreMissingKeyInMap("x-goog-version")'
      - name: 'noWrapper'
        type: NestedObject
        description: |
          When set, the payload to the push endpoint is not wrapped.Sets the
          `data` field as the HTTP body for delivery.

        properties:
          - name: 'writeMetadata'
            type: Boolean
            description: |
              When true, writes the Pub/Sub message metadata to
              `x-goog-pubsub-<KEY>:<VAL>` headers of the HTTP request. Writes the
              Pub/Sub message attributes to `<KEY>:<VAL>` headers of the HTTP request.
            required: true
            send_empty_value: true
  - name: 'ackDeadlineSeconds'
    type: Integer
    description: |
      This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message
      before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message
      delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is
      acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered
      again during that time (on a best-effort basis).

      For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for
      the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
      subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
      pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
      maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
      If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.

      For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
      for the call to the push endpoint.

      If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system
      will eventually redeliver the message.
    default_from_api: true
  - name: 'messageRetentionDuration'
    type: String
    description: |
      How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
      backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
      retain_acked_messages is true, then this also configures the retention
      of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a
      subscriptions.seek can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more
      than 7 days (`"604800s"`) or less than 10 minutes (`"600s"`).

      A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated
      by 's'. Example: `"600.5s"`.
    default_value: 604800s
  - name: 'retainAckedMessages'
    type: Boolean
    description: |
      Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If `true`, then
      messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if
      they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the
      messageRetentionDuration window.
  - name: 'expirationPolicy'
    type: NestedObject
    description: |
      A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration.
      A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber
      is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing
      operations on the subscription. If expirationPolicy is not set, a default
      policy with ttl of 31 days will be used.  If it is set but ttl is "", the
      resource never expires.  The minimum allowed value for expirationPolicy.ttl
      is 1 day.
    default_from_api: true
    send_empty_value: true
    allow_empty_object: true
    properties:
      - name: 'ttl'
        type: String
        description: |
          Specifies the "time-to-live" duration for an associated resource. The
          resource expires if it is not active for a period of ttl.
          If ttl is set to "", the associated resource never expires.
          A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'.
          Example - "3.5s".
        required: true
        diff_suppress_func: 'comparePubsubSubscriptionExpirationPolicy'
  - name: 'filter'
    type: String
    description: |
      The subscription only delivers the messages that match the filter.
      Pub/Sub automatically acknowledges the messages that don't match the filter. You can filter messages
      by their attributes. The maximum length of a filter is 256 bytes. After creating the subscription,
      you can't modify the filter.
    required: false
    immutable: true
  - name: 'deadLetterPolicy'
    type: NestedObject
    description: |
      A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in
      this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering
      is disabled.

      The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscription's
      parent project (i.e.,
      service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have
      permission to Acknowledge() messages on this subscription.
    send_empty_value: true
    properties:
      - name: 'deadLetterTopic'
        type: String
        description: |
          The name of the topic to which dead letter messages should be published.
          Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`.

          The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with the enclosing subscription's
          parent project (i.e.,
          service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have
          permission to Publish() to this topic.

          The operation will fail if the topic does not exist.
          Users should ensure that there is a subscription attached to this topic
          since messages published to a topic with no subscriptions are lost.
      - name: 'maxDeliveryAttempts'
        type: Integer
        description: |
          The maximum number of delivery attempts for any message. The value must be
          between 5 and 100.

          The number of delivery attempts is defined as 1 + (the sum of number of
          NACKs and number of times the acknowledgement deadline has been exceeded for the message).

          A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. Note that
          client libraries may automatically extend ack_deadlines.

          This field will be honored on a best effort basis.

          If this parameter is 0, a default value of 5 is used.
  - name: 'retryPolicy'
    type: NestedObject
    description: |
      A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this subscription.

      If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers.
      RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message
    properties:
      - name: 'minimumBackoff'
        type: String
        description: |
          The minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a given message. Value should be between 0 and 600 seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.
          A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'. Example: "3.5s".

        default_from_api: true
        diff_suppress_func: 'tpgresource.DurationDiffSuppress'
  - name: 'enableMessageOrdering'
    type: Boolean
    description: |
      If `true`, messages published with the same orderingKey in PubsubMessage will be delivered to
      the subscribers in the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they
      may be delivered in any order.
    immutable: true
  - name: 'enableExactlyOnceDelivery'
    type: Boolean
    description: |
      If `true`, Pub/Sub provides the following guarantees for the delivery
      of a message with a given value of messageId on this Subscriptions':

      - The message sent to a subscriber is guaranteed not to be resent before the message's acknowledgement deadline expires.

      - An acknowledged message will not be resent to a subscriber.

      Note that subscribers may still receive multiple copies of a message when `enable_exactly_once_delivery`
      is true if the message was published multiple times by a publisher client. These copies are considered distinct by Pub/Sub and have distinct messageId values
