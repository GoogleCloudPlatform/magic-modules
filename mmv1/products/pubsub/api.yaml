            description: |
              Endpoint configuration attributes.

              Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can
              be used to control different aspects of the message delivery.

              The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you
              can use to change the format of the pushed message. This
              attribute indicates the version of the data expected by
              the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message
              (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
              based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.

              If not present during the subscriptions.create call,
              it will default to the version of the API used to make
              such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig
              call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get
              calls will always return a valid version, even if the
              subscription was created without this attribute.

              The possible values for this attribute are:

              - v1beta1: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.
              - v1 or v1beta2: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
        name: 'ackDeadlineSeconds'
        description: |
          This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message
          before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message
          delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is
          acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered
          again during that time (on a best-effort basis).

          For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for
          the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
          subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
          pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
          maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
          If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.

          For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
          for the call to the push endpoint.

          If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system
          will eventually redeliver the message.

        name: 'messageRetentionDuration'

        description: |
          How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
          backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
          retainAckedMessages is true, then this also configures the retention
          of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a
          subscriptions.seek can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more
          than 7 days (`"604800s"`) or less than 10 minutes (`"600s"`).

          A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated
          by 's'. Example: `"600.5s"`.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
        name: 'retainAckedMessages'
        description: |
          Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If `true`, then
          messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if
          they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the
          messageRetentionDuration window.

        description: |
          A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration.
          A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber
          is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing
          operations on the subscription. If expirationPolicy is not set, a default
          policy with ttl of 31 days will be used.  If it is set but ttl is "", the
          resource never expires.  The minimum allowed value for expirationPolicy.ttl
          is 1 day.
        properties:
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
            name: 'ttl'

              If ttl is not set, the associated resource never expires.
              A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'.
              Example - "3.5s".
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String

        required: false
        description: |
          The subscription only delivers the messages that match the filter. 
          Pub/Sub automatically acknowledges the messages that don't match the filter. You can filter messages
          by their attributes. The maximum length of a filter is 256 bytes. After creating the subscription, 
          you can't modify the filter.

          A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering messages in
          this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering
          is disabled.
          
          The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this subscription's
          parent project (i.e.,
          service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have

              The name of the topic to which dead letter messages should be published.
              Format is `projects/{project}/topics/{topic}`.

              The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with the enclosing subscription's
              parent project (i.e., 
              service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com) must have
              permission to Publish() to this topic.
              
              The operation will fail if the topic does not exist.
              Users should ensure that there is a subscription attached to this topic
              since messages published to a topic with no subscriptions are lost.
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
            name: 'maxDeliveryAttempts'
            description: |
              The maximum number of delivery attempts for any message. The value must be
              between 5 and 100.
              
              The number of delivery attempts is defined as 1 + (the sum of number of 
              NACKs and number of times the acknowledgement deadline has been exceeded for the message).
              
              A NACK is any call to ModifyAckDeadline with a 0 deadline. Note that
              client libraries may automatically extend ack_deadlines.
              
              This field will be honored on a best effort basis.
            
              If this parameter is 0, a default value of 5 is used.

          A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries message delivery for this subscription.

          If not set, the default retry policy is applied. This generally implies that messages will be retried as soon as possible for healthy subscribers. 
          RetryPolicy will be triggered on NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded events for a given message
