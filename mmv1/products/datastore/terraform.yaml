      warning: |
        This resource creates a Datastore Index on a project that has already
        enabled a Datastore-compatible database. If you haven't already enabled
        one, you can create a `google_app_engine_application` resource with
        `database_type` set to `"CLOUD_DATASTORE_COMPATIBILITY"` to do so. Your
        Datastore location will be the same as the App Engine location specified.
