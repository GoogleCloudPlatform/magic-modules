name: 'ResponsePolicyRule'
kind: 'dns#responsePolicyRule'
description: |
  A Response Policy Rule is a selector that applies its behavior to queries that match the selector.
  Selectors are DNS names, which may be wildcards or exact matches.
  Each DNS query subject to a Response Policy matches at most one ResponsePolicyRule,
  as identified by the dns_name field with the longest matching suffix.
