                The name of the container image that will run this particular build step.

                If the image is available in the host's Docker daemon's cache, it will be
                run directly. If not, the host will attempt to pull the image first, using
                the builder service account's credentials if necessary.

                The Docker daemon's cache will already have the latest versions of all of
                the officially supported build steps (see https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders
                for images and examples).
                The Docker daemon will also have cached many of the layers for some popular
                images, like "ubuntu", "debian", but they will be refreshed at the time
                you attempt to use them.

                If you built an image in a previous build step, it will be stored in the
                host's Docker daemon's cache and is available to use as the name for a
                later build step.

              Global list of volumes to mount for ALL build steps

              Each volume is created as an empty volume prior to starting the build process.
              Upon completion of the build, volumes and their contents are discarded. Global
              volume names and paths cannot conflict with the volumes defined a build step.

              Using a global volume in a build with only one step is not valid as it is indicative
              of a build request with an incorrect configuration.

                    Name of the volume to mount.

                    Volume names must be unique per build step and must be valid names for Docker volumes.
                    Each named volume must be used by at least two build steps.

                    build step or with certain reserved volume paths.
