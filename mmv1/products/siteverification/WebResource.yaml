  A web resource is a website or domain with verified ownership. Once your
  ownership is verified you will be able to manage your website in the
  [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/).

  ~> **Note:** The verification data (DNS `TXT` record, HTML file, `meta` tag, etc.)
  must already exist before the web resource is created, and must be deleted before
  the web resource is destroyed. The Google Site Verification API checks that the
  verification data exists at creation time and does not exist at destruction time
  and will fail if the required condition is not met.
