        required: true
        description: |
          A key ring organizes keys in a specific Google Cloud location and allows you to
          manage access control on groups of keys. A key ring's name does not need to be
          unique across a Google Cloud project, but must be unique within a given location.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
        name: "key"
        required: true
        description: |
          A Cloud KMS key is a named object containing one or more key versions, along
          with metadata for the key. A key exists on exactly one key ring tied to a
          specific location.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
        name: "keyVersion"
        description: |
          Each version of a key contains key material used for encryption or signing.
          A key's version is represented by an integer, starting at 1. To decrypt data
          or verify a signature, you must use the same key version that was used to
          encrypt or sign the data.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
        name: "kmsProjectId"
        description: |
          The Google Cloud project id of the project where the kms key stored. If empty,
          the kms key is stored at the same project as customer's project and ecrypted
          with CMEK, otherwise, the kms key is stored in the tenant project and
          encrypted with GMEK.
