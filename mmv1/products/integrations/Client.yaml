        type: String
        description: |
          A key ring organizes keys in a specific Google Cloud location and allows you to
          manage access control on groups of keys. A key ring's name does not need to be
          unique across a Google Cloud project, but must be unique within a given location.
        required: true
      - name: 'key'
        type: String
        description: |
          A Cloud KMS key is a named object containing one or more key versions, along
          with metadata for the key. A key exists on exactly one key ring tied to a
          specific location.
        required: true
      - name: 'keyVersion'
        type: String
        description: |
          Each version of a key contains key material used for encryption or signing.
          A key's version is represented by an integer, starting at 1. To decrypt data
          or verify a signature, you must use the same key version that was used to
          encrypt or sign the data.
      - name: 'kmsProjectId'
        type: String
        description: |

          the kms key is stored at the same project as customer's project and ecrypted
          with CMEK, otherwise, the kms key is stored in the tenant project and
          encrypted with GMEK.
