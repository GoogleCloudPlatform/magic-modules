              Minimum age for a Backup created via this BackupPlan (in days).
              Must be an integer value between 0-90 (inclusive).
              A Backup created under this BackupPlan will not be deletable
              until it reaches Backup's (create time + backup_delete_lock_days).
              Updating this field of a BackupPlan does not affect existing Backups.
              Backups created after a successful update will inherit this new value.
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
            name: backupRetainDays
            description: |
              The default maximum age of a Backup created via this BackupPlan.
              This field MUST be an integer value >= 0 and <= 365. If specified,
              a Backup created under this BackupPlan will be automatically deleted
              after its age reaches (createTime + backupRetainDays).
              If not specified, Backups created under this BackupPlan will NOT be
              subject to automatic deletion. Updating this field does NOT affect
              existing Backups under it. Backups created AFTER a successful update
              will automatically pick up the new value.
              NOTE: backupRetainDays must be >= backupDeleteLockDays.
              If cronSchedule is defined, then this must be <= 360 * the creation interval.]
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
            name: locked
            description: |
              This flag denotes whether the retention policy of this BackupPlan is locked.
              If set to True, no further update is allowed on this policy, including
              the locked field itself.

          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
              name: paused
              description: |
                This flag denotes whether automatic Backup creation is paused for this BackupPlan.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
        name: etag
        output: true
        description: |
          etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous
          updates of a backup plan from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that
          systems make use of the 'etag' in the read-modify-write cycle to perform BackupPlan updates
          in order to avoid race conditions: An etag is returned in the response to backupPlans.get,
          and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to backupPlans.patch or
          backupPlans.delete to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the resource.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
        name: deactivated
        description: |
         This flag indicates whether this BackupPlan has been deactivated.
         Setting this field to True locks the BackupPlan such that no further updates will be allowed
         (except deletes), including the deactivated field itself. It also prevents any new Backups
         from being created via this BackupPlan (including scheduled Backups).

          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
            name: includeVolumeData
            description: |
              This flag specifies whether volume data should be backed up when PVCs are
              included in the scope of a Backup.
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
            name: includeSecrets
            description: |
              This flag specifies whether Kubernetes Secret resources should be included
              when they fall into the scope of Backups.
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::NestedObject
            name: encryptionKey
            description: |
              This defines a customer managed encryption key that will be used to encrypt the "config"
              portion (the Kubernetes resources) of Backups created via this plan.
