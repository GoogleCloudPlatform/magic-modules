parameters:
  - name: 'location'
    type: String
    description: |
      The geographic location where the transfer config should reside.
      Examples: US, EU, asia-northeast1. The default value is US.
    url_param_only: true
    immutable: true
    default_value: "US"
  - name: 'name'
    type: String
    description: |
      The name of the reservation. This field must only contain alphanumeric characters or dash.
    url_param_only: true
    required: true
    immutable: true
properties:
  - name: 'slotCapacity'
    type: Integer
    description: |
      Minimum slots available to this reservation. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the
      unit of parallelism. Queries using this reservation might use more slots during runtime if ignoreIdleSlots is set to false.
    required: true
  - name: 'ignoreIdleSlots'
    type: Boolean
    description: |
      If false, any query using this reservation will use idle slots from other reservations within
      the same admin project. If true, a query using this reservation will execute with the slot
      capacity specified above at most.
    default_value: false
  - name: 'concurrency'
    type: Integer
    description: |
      Maximum number of queries that are allowed to run concurrently in this reservation. This is a soft limit due to asynchronous nature of the system and various optimizations for small queries. Default value is 0 which means that concurrency will be automatically set based on the reservation size.
    default_value: 0
  - name: 'edition'
    type: String
    description: |
      The edition type. Valid values are STANDARD, ENTERPRISE, ENTERPRISE_PLUS
    immutable: true
    default_from_api: true
  - name: 'autoscale'
    type: NestedObject
    description: |
      The configuration parameters for the auto scaling feature.
    properties:
      - name: 'currentSlots'
        type: Integer
        description: |
          The slot capacity added to this reservation when autoscale happens. Will be between [0, max_slots].
        output: true
      - name: 'maxSlots'
        type: Integer
        description: |
          Number of slots to be scaled when needed.
  - name: 'primaryLocation'
    type: String
    description: |
      The current location of the reservation's primary replica. This field is only set for
      reservations using the managed disaster recovery feature.
    output: true
  - name: 'secondaryLocation'
    type: String
    description: |
      The current location of the reservation's secondary replica. This field is only set for
      reservations using the managed disaster recovery feature. Users can set this in create
      reservation calls to create a failover reservation or in update reservation calls to convert
      a non-failover reservation to a failover reservation(or vice versa).
  - name: 'originalPrimaryLocation'
    type: String
    description: |
      The location where the reservation was originally created. This is set only during the
      failover reservation's creation. All billing charges for the failover reservation will be
      applied to this location.
    output: true
  - name: 'replicationStatus'
    type: NestedObject
    description: |
      The Disaster Recovery(DR) replication status of the reservation. This is only available for
      the primary replicas of DR/failover reservations and provides information about the both the
      staleness of the secondary and the last error encountered while trying to replicate changes
      from the primary to the secondary. If this field is blank, it means that the reservation is
      either not a DR reservation or the reservation is a DR secondary or that any replication
      operations on the reservation have succeeded.
    properties:
      - name: 'error'
        type: NestedObject
        description: |
          The last error encountered while trying to replicate changes from the primary to the
          secondary. This field is only available if the replication has not succeeded since.
        properties:
          - name: 'code'
            type: Integer
            description: |
              The status code, which should be an enum value of [google.rpc.Code](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/reservations/rpc/google.rpc#google.rpc.Code).
            output: true
          - name: 'message'
            type: String
            description: |
              A developer-facing error message, which should be in English.

        output: true
      - name: 'lastErrorTime'
        type: Time
        description: |
          The time at which the last error was encountered while trying to replicate changes from
          the primary to the secondary. This field is only available if the replication has not
          succeeded since.
        output: true
      - name: 'lastReplicationTime'
        type: Time
        description: |
          A timestamp corresponding to the last change on the primary that was successfully
          replicated to the secondary.
        output: true
    output: true
