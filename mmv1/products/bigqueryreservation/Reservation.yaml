    description: |
      The geographic location where the transfer config should reside.
      Examples: US, EU, asia-northeast1. The default value is US.

    url_param_only: true
    immutable: true
    required: true
    description: |
      The name of the reservation. This field must only contain alphanumeric characters or dash.
properties:
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
    name: 'slotCapacity'
    required: true
    description: |
      Minimum slots available to this reservation. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the
      unit of parallelism. Queries using this reservation might use more slots during runtime if ignoreIdleSlots is set to false.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
    name: 'ignoreIdleSlots'
    default_value: false
    description: |
      If false, any query using this reservation will use idle slots from other reservations within
      the same admin project. If true, a query using this reservation will execute with the slot
      capacity specified above at most.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
    name: 'concurrency'
    default_value: 0
    description: |
      Maximum number of queries that are allowed to run concurrently in this reservation. This is a soft limit due to asynchronous nature of the system and various optimizations for small queries. Default value is 0 which means that concurrency will be automatically set based on the reservation size.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
    name: 'multiRegionAuxiliary'
    description: |
      Applicable only for reservations located within one of the BigQuery multi-regions (US or EU).
      If set to true, this reservation is placed in the organization's secondary region which is designated for disaster recovery purposes. If false, this reservation is placed in the organization's default region.
    deprecation_message: "`multi_region_auxiliary` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. This field is no longer supported by the BigQuery Reservation API."

      The configuration parameters for the auto scaling feature.
    properties:
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
        name: currentSlots
        output: true
        description: |
          The slot capacity added to this reservation when autoscale happens. Will be between [0, max_slots].
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
        name: maxSlots
        description: |
          Number of slots to be scaled when needed.
