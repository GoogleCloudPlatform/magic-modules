    type: String
    description: |
      The host state of your domain name. Host state is determined by checking each
      IP address associated with your domain name to see if it's serving
      Hosting content.
        HOST_UNHOSTED:
          Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name isn't associated with any IP addresses.

        HOST_UNREACHABLE:
          Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name can't be reached. Hosting services' DNS
          queries to find your domain name's IP addresses resulted in errors. See
          your `CustomDomain`'s `issues` field for more details.

        HOST_MISMATCH:
          Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has IP addresses that don't ultimately
          resolve to Hosting.

        HOST_CONFLICT:
          Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has IP addresses that resolve to both
          Hosting and other services. To ensure consistent results, remove `A` and
          `AAAA` records related to non-Hosting services.

        HOST_ACTIVE:
          All requests against your `CustomDomain`'s domain name are served by
          Hosting. If the `CustomDomain`'s `OwnershipState` is also `ACTIVE`, Hosting
          serves your Hosting Site's content on the domain name.
    min_version: 'beta'
    output: true
  - name: 'ownershipState'
    type: Enum
    description: |
      The ownership state of your domain name. Ownership is determined at a
      Firebase project level, and established by adding `TXT` records to your
      domain name's DNS records.

      Ownership cascades to subdomains. Granting a project ownership of `foo.com`
      also grants that project ownership over `bar.foo.com`, unless you add
      specific `TXT` records to `bar.foo.com` that grant a different project
      ownership.

      If your `CustomDomain` is in an `OwnershipState` other than
      `OWNERSHIP_ACTIVE` for more than 30 days and it hasn't been updated in at
      least 30 days, Hosting's ownership systems delete the `CustomDomain`.

      OWNERSHIP_MISSING:
        Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has no Hosting-related ownership records;
        no Firebase project has permission to act on the domain name's behalf.

      OWNERSHIP_UNREACHABLE:
        Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name can't be reached. Hosting services' DNS
        queries to find your domain name's ownership records resulted in errors.
        See your `CustomDomain`'s `issues` field for more details.

      OWNERSHIP_MISMATCH:
        Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name is owned by another Firebase project.
        Remove the conflicting `TXT` records and replace them with project-specific
        records for your current Firebase project.

      OWNERSHIP_CONFLICT:
        Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has conflicting `TXT` records that
        indicate ownership by both your current Firebase project and another
        project. Remove the other project's ownership records to grant the current
        project ownership.

      OWNERSHIP_PENDING:
        Your `CustomDomain`'s DNS records are configured correctly. Hosting will
        transfer ownership of your domain to this `CustomDomain` within 24 hours.

      OWNERSHIP_ACTIVE:
        Your `CustomDomain`'s domain name has `TXT` records that grant its project
        permission to act on its behalf.
