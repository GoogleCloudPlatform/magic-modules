  Security Command Center finding.
  
  A finding is a record of assessment data like security, risk, health, or privacy,
  that is ingested into Security Command Center for presentation, notification,
  analysis, policy testing, and enforcement.
  
  For example, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in an App Engine application is a finding.
