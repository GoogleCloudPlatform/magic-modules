    name: filter
    description: |
      Expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update
      events of findings. The
      expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via
      logical operators AND and OR. Parentheses are supported, and OR
      has higher precedence than AND.

      Restrictions have the form <field> <operator> <value> and may have
      a - character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields
      map to those defined in the corresponding resource.

      The supported operators are:

      * = for all value types.
      * >, <, >=, <= for integer values.
      * :, meaning substring matching, for strings.

      The supported value types are:

      * string literals in quotes.
      * integer literals without quotes.
      * boolean literals true and false without quotes.

      See
      [Filtering notifications](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-api-filter-notifications)
      for information on how to write a filter.
