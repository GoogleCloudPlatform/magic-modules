  A Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) notification configs. A
  notification config is a Cloud SCC resource that contains the
  configuration to send notifications for create/update events of
  findings, assets and etc.

    properties:

        type: String
        description: |
          Expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update
          events of assets or findings as specified by the event type. The
          expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via
          logical operators AND and OR. Parentheses are supported, and OR
          has higher precedence than AND.

          Restrictions have the form <field> <operator> <value> and may have
          a - character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields
          map to those defined in the corresponding resource.

          The supported operators are:

          * = for all value types.
          * >, <, >=, <= for integer values.
          * :, meaning substring matching, for strings.

          The supported value types are:

          * string literals in quotes.
          * integer literals without quotes.
          * boolean literals true and false without quotes.

          See
          [Filtering notifications](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-api-filter-notifications)
          for information on how to write a filter.
