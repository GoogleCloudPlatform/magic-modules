name: 'Entry'
description: |
  An entry represents a data asset for which you capture metadata, such as a BigQuery table.
  The primary constituents of an entry are aspects, which provide thematically coherent information.
  Examples include a table's schema, sensitive data protection profile, data quality information, or a simple tag.

  **Important Considerations:**

  * There is a limit of 99 aspects per entry.
  * The entry resource has to use project numbers and not project IDs. Therefore, if
    a dependency was already provisioned using project ID, it needs to be referenced explicitly as a resource name
    containing the project number.

          By default, this should match the location of the entry group containing this entry.
          A different value allows capturing the source location for data external to Google Cloud.
