            Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.

            You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
            (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the
            source location.

            Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
            a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must
            also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
            which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
            information.

            If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
            you must provide the destination VPC network.

            If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
            network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
            identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
            address or VPC network.

            A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
            ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that
            you don't intend to test.

                The following are two cases where you must provide the project ID:

                1. Only the IP address is specified, and the IP address is
                   within a GCP project.
                2. When you are using Shared VPC and the IP address
                   that you provide is from the service project. In this case,
                   the network that the IP address resides in is defined in the
                   host project.

          Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.

          You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute
          Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
          destination location.

          Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
          location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
          endpoint from route information.

          If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
          multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
          destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
          interface.

          A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
          is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you
          don't intend to test.
