  that enables you to evaluate connectivity to and from Google Cloud
  resources in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.

      Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.

      You can use a combination of source IP address, URI of a supported
      endpoint, project ID, or VPC network to identify the source location.

      Reachability analysis might proceed even if the source location is
      ambiguous. However, the test result might include endpoints or use a source
      that you don't intend to test.
