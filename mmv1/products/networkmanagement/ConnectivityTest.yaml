  that enables you to evaluate connectivity to and from Google Cloud
  resources in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.

      Required. Source specification of the Connectivity Test.

      You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine
      (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the
      source location.

      Examples: If the source IP address is an internal IP address within
      a Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, then you must
      also specify the VPC network. Otherwise, specify the VM instance,
      which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network
      information.

      If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then
      you must provide the destination VPC network.

      If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple
      network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to
      identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP
      address or VPC network.

      A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is
      ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that
      you don't intend to test.

          Project ID where the endpoint is located. The Project ID can be

          The following are two cases where you must provide the project ID:

          1. Only the IP address is specified, and the IP address is
             within a GCP project.
          2. When you are using Shared VPC and the IP address
             that you provide is from the service project. In this case,
             the network that the IP address resides in is defined in the
             host project.
  - name: 'destination'
    type: NestedObject
    description: |
      Required. Destination specification of the Connectivity Test.

      You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute
      Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the
      destination location.

      Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP
      location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination
      endpoint from route information.

      If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has
      multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a
      destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination
      interface.

      A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location
      is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you
      don't intend to test.
