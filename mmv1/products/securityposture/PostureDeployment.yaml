--- !ruby/object:Api::Resource
name: 'PostureDeployment'
description: |
  Represents a deployment of a security posture on a resource. A posture contains user curated policy sets. A posture can
  be deployed on a project or on a folder or on an organization. To deploy a posture we need to populate the posture's name
  and its revision_id in the posture deployment configuration. Every update to a deployed posture generates a new revision_id.
  Thus, the updated revision_id should be used in the respective posture deployment's configuration to deploy that posture
  on a resource.
