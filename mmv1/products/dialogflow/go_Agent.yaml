  A Dialogflow agent is a virtual agent that handles conversations with your end-users. It is a natural language
  understanding module that understands the nuances of human language. Dialogflow translates end-user text or audio
  during a conversation to structured data that your apps and services can understand. You design and build a Dialogflow
  agent to handle the types of conversations required for your system.

    description: |
      The default language of the agent as a language tag. [See Language Support](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/reference/language)
      for a list of the currently supported language codes. This field cannot be updated after creation.

      type: String
  - name: 'timeZone'
    type: String
    description: |
      The time zone of this agent from the [time zone database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones), e.g., America/New_York,
      Europe/Paris.
    required: true
  - name: 'description'
    type: String
    description: |
      The description of this agent. The maximum length is 500 characters. If exceeded, the request is rejected.

  - name: 'avatarUri'
    type: String
    description: |
      The URI of the agent's avatar, which are used throughout the Dialogflow console. When an image URL is entered
      into this field, the Dialogflow will save the image in the backend. The address of the backend image returned
      from the API will be shown in the [avatarUriBackend] field.
    ignore_read: true
  - name: 'avatarUriBackend'
    type: String
    description: |
      The URI of the agent's avatar as returned from the API. Output only. To provide an image URL for the agent avatar,
      the [avatarUri] field can be used.

    type: Boolean
    description: |
      Determines whether this agent should log conversation queries.
  - name: 'matchMode'
    type: Enum
    description: |
      Determines how intents are detected from user queries.
      * MATCH_MODE_HYBRID: Best for agents with a small number of examples in intents and/or wide use of templates
      syntax and composite entities.
      * MATCH_MODE_ML_ONLY: Can be used for agents with a large number of examples in intents, especially the ones
      using @sys.any or very large developer entities.
    default_from_api: true
    enum_values:
      - 'MATCH_MODE_HYBRID'
      - 'MATCH_MODE_ML_ONLY'
  - name: 'classificationThreshold'
    type: Double
    description: |
      To filter out false positive results and still get variety in matched natural language inputs for your agent,
      you can tune the machine learning classification threshold. If the returned score value is less than the threshold
      value, then a fallback intent will be triggered or, if there are no fallback intents defined, no intent will be
      triggered. The score values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). If set to 0.0, the
      default of 0.3 is used.
  - name: 'apiVersion'
    type: Enum
    description: |
      API version displayed in Dialogflow console. If not specified, V2 API is assumed. Clients are free to query
      different service endpoints for different API versions. However, bots connectors and webhook calls will follow
      the specified API version.
      * API_VERSION_V1: Legacy V1 API.
      * API_VERSION_V2: V2 API.
      * API_VERSION_V2_BETA_1: V2beta1 API.
    default_from_api: true
    enum_values:
      - 'API_VERSION_V1'
      - 'API_VERSION_V2'
      - 'API_VERSION_V2_BETA_1'
  - name: 'tier'
    type: Enum
    description: |
      The agent tier. If not specified, TIER_STANDARD is assumed.
      * TIER_STANDARD: Standard tier.
      * TIER_ENTERPRISE: Enterprise tier (Essentials).
      * TIER_ENTERPRISE_PLUS: Enterprise tier (Plus).
      NOTE: Due to consistency issues, the provider will not read this field from the API. Drift is possible between
      the Terraform state and Dialogflow if the agent tier is changed outside of Terraform.
    ignore_read: true
    enum_values:
      - 'TIER_STANDARD'
      - 'TIER_ENTERPRISE'
      - 'TIER_ENTERPRISE_PLUS'
