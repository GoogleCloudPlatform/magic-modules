name: 'InterceptEndpointGroupAssociation'
description: |-
  An endpoint group association represents a link between a network and an
  endpoint group in the organization.

  Creating an association creates the networking infrastructure linking the
  network to the endpoint group, but does not enable intercept by itself.
  To enable intercept, the user must also create a network firewall policy
  containing intercept rules and associate it with the network.
