name: 'FirewallEndpointAssociation'
description: |
  Firewall endpoint association links a firewall endpoint to a VPC network in
  the same zone. After you define this association, Cloud Firewall forwards the
  zonal workload traffic in your VPC network that requires layer 7 inspection to
  the attached firewall endpoint.
