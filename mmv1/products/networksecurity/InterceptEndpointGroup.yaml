name: 'InterceptEndpointGroup'
description: |-
  An endpoint group is a consumer frontend for a deployment group (backend).
  In order to configure intercept for a network, consumers must create:
  - An association between their network and the endpoint group.
  - A security profile that points to the endpoint group.
  - A firewall rule that references the security profile (group).
