              Expression that defines the filter to apply across create/update
              events of assets or findings as specified by the event type. The
              expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via
              logical operators AND and OR. Parentheses are supported, and OR
              has higher precedence than AND.

              Restrictions have the form <field> <operator> <value> and may have
              a - character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields
              map to those defined in the corresponding resource.

              The supported operators are:

              * = for all value types.
              * >, <, >=, <= for integer values.
              * :, meaning substring matching, for strings.

              The supported value types are:

              * string literals in quotes.
              * integer literals without quotes.
              * boolean literals true and false without quotes.

              See
              [Filtering notifications](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/how-to-api-filter-notifications)
              for information on how to write a filter.
