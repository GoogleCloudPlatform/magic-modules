name: AnalysisRule
description: |
  The CCAI Insights project wide analysis rule.
  This rule will be applied to all conversations that match the filter defined in the rule.
  For a conversation matches the filter, the annotators specified in the rule will be run.
  If a conversation matches multiple rules, a union of all the annotators will be run.
  One project can have multiple analysis rules.
