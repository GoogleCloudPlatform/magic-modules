name: 'FolderSecurityHealthAnalyticsCustomModule'
description: |
  Represents an instance of a Security Health Analytics custom module, including
  its full module name, display name, enablement state, and last updated time.
  You can create a custom module at the organization, folder, or project level.
  Custom modules that you create at the organization or folder level are inherited
  by the child folders and projects.
