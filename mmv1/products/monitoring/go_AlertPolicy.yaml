                      The set of fields to preserve when

                      The groupByFields determine how
                      the time series are partitioned
                      into subsets prior to applying the
                      aggregation function. Each subset

                      same value for each of the
                      grouping fields. Each individual
                      time series is a member of exactly
                      one subset. The crossSeriesReducer
                      is applied to each subset of time
                      series. It is not possible to

                      types, so this field implicitly
                      contains resource.type. Fields not
                      specified in groupByFields are
                      aggregated away. If groupByFields
                      is not specified and all the time
                      series have the same resource
                      type, then the time series are
                      aggregated into a single output
                      time series. If crossSeriesReducer
                      is not defined, this field is
                      ignored.

                      The set of fields to preserve when

                      The groupByFields determine how
                      the time series are partitioned
                      into subsets prior to applying the
                      aggregation function. Each subset
                      contains time series that have the
                      same value for each of the
                      grouping fields. Each individual
                      time series is a member of exactly
                      one subset. The crossSeriesReducer
                      is applied to each subset of time
                      series. It is not possible to
                      reduce across different resource
                      types, so this field implicitly
                      contains resource.type. Fields not
                      specified in groupByFields are
                      aggregated away. If groupByFields
                      is not specified and all the time
                      series have the same resource
                      type, then the time series are
                      aggregated into a single output
                      time series. If crossSeriesReducer
                      is not defined, this field is
