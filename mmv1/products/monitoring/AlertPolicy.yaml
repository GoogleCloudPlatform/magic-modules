                      The set of fields to preserve when
                      crossSeriesReducer is specified.
                      The groupByFields determine how
                      the time series are partitioned
                      into subsets prior to applying the
                      aggregation function. Each subset
                      contains time series that have the
                      same value for each of the
                      grouping fields. Each individual
                      time series is a member of exactly
                      one subset. The crossSeriesReducer
                      is applied to each subset of time
                      series. It is not possible to
                      reduce across different resource
                      types, so this field implicitly
                      contains resource.type. Fields not
                      specified in groupByFields are
                      aggregated away. If groupByFields
                      is not specified and all the time
                      series have the same resource
                      type, then the time series are
                      aggregated into a single output
                      time series. If crossSeriesReducer
                      is not defined, this field is

                      The set of fields to preserve when
                      crossSeriesReducer is specified.
                      The groupByFields determine how
                      the time series are partitioned
                      into subsets prior to applying the
                      aggregation function. Each subset
                      contains time series that have the
                      same value for each of the
                      grouping fields. Each individual
                      time series is a member of exactly
                      one subset. The crossSeriesReducer
                      is applied to each subset of time
                      series. It is not possible to
                      reduce across different resource
                      types, so this field implicitly
                      contains resource.type. Fields not
                      specified in groupByFields are
                      aggregated away. If groupByFields
                      is not specified and all the time
                      series have the same resource
                      type, then the time series are
                      aggregated into a single output
                      time series. If crossSeriesReducer
                      is not defined, this field is
                      ignored.

                The amount of time that a time series must
                violate the threshold to be considered
                failing. Currently, only values that are a

                value is given, an error will be returned.
                When choosing a duration, it is useful to
                keep in mind the frequency of the underlying
                time series data (which may also be affected
                by any alignments specified in the
                aggregations field); a good duration is long
                enough so that a single outlier does not
                generate spurious alerts, but short enough
                that unhealthy states are detected and
                alerted on quickly.

                      The set of fields to preserve when
                      crossSeriesReducer is specified.
                      The groupByFields determine how
                      the time series are partitioned
                      into subsets prior to applying the
                      aggregation function. Each subset
                      contains time series that have the
                      same value for each of the
                      grouping fields. Each individual
                      time series is a member of exactly
                      one subset. The crossSeriesReducer
                      is applied to each subset of time
                      series. It is not possible to
                      reduce across different resource
                      types, so this field implicitly
                      contains resource.type. Fields not
                      specified in groupByFields are
                      aggregated away. If groupByFields
                      is not specified and all the time
                      series have the same resource
                      type, then the time series are
                      aggregated into a single output
                      time series. If crossSeriesReducer
                      is not defined, this field is
                      ignored.
