  update_verb: :PATCH
  description: |
    A NotificationChannel is a medium through which an alert is delivered
    when a policy violation is detected. Examples of channels include email, SMS,
    and third-party messaging applications. Fields containing sensitive information
    like authentication tokens or contact info are only partially populated on retrieval.

    Notification Channels are designed to be flexible and are made up of a supported `type`
    and labels to configure that channel. Each `type` has specific labels that need to be
    present for that channel to be correctly configured. The labels that are required to be
    present for one channel `type` are often different than those required for another.
    Due to these loose constraints it's often best to set up a channel through the UI
    and import to Terraform when setting up a brand new channel type to determine which
    labels are required.

    A list of supported channels per project the `list` endpoint can be
    accessed programmatically or through the api explorer at  https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list .
    This provides the channel type and all of the required labels that must be passed.

    description: Indicates whether this channel has been verified or not. On a ListNotificationChannels
      or GetNotificationChannel operation, this field is expected to be populated.If
      the value is UNVERIFIED, then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning
      (it both requires verification and lacks verification); otherwise, it is assumed
      that the channel works.If the channel is neither VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED, it
      implies that the channel is of a type that does not require verification or
      that this specific channel has been exempted from verification because it was
      created prior to verification being required for channels of this type.This
      field cannot be modified using a standard UpdateNotificationChannel operation.
      To change the value of this field, you must call VerifyNotificationChannel.

  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::KeyValuePairs
    name: userLabels
    description: User-supplied key/value data that does not need to conform to the
      corresponding NotificationChannelDescriptor's schema, unlike the labels field.
      This field is intended to be used for organizing and identifying the NotificationChannel
      objects.The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value is limited
      to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values
      can contain only lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys
      must begin with a letter.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: description
    description: An optional human-readable description of this notification channel.
      This description may provide additional details, beyond the display name, for
      the channel. This may not exceed 1024 Unicode characters.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
    name: displayName
    description: An optional human-readable name for this notification channel. It
      is recommended that you specify a non-empty and unique name in order to make
      it easier to identify the channels in your project, though this is not enforced.
      The display name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.
  - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
    name: enabled
    default_value: true
    send_empty_value: true
    description: Whether notifications are forwarded to the described channel. This
      makes it possible to disable delivery of notifications to a particular channel
      without removing the channel from all alerting policies that reference the channel.
      This is a more convenient approach when the change is temporary and you want
      to receive notifications from the same set of alerting policies on the channel
      at some point in the future.
