description: |
  A NotificationChannel is a medium through which an alert is delivered
  when a policy violation is detected. Examples of channels include email, SMS,
  and third-party messaging applications. Fields containing sensitive information
  like authentication tokens or contact info are only partially populated on retrieval.

  Notification Channels are designed to be flexible and are made up of a supported `type`
  and labels to configure that channel. Each `type` has specific labels that need to be
  present for that channel to be correctly configured. The labels that are required to be
  present for one channel `type` are often different than those required for another.
  Due to these loose constraints it's often best to set up a channel through the UI
  and import to Terraform when setting up a brand new channel type to determine which
  labels are required.

  A list of supported channels per project the `list` endpoint can be
  accessed programmatically or through the api explorer at  https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list .
  This provides the channel type and all of the required labels that must be passed.

- !ruby/object:Api::Type::Enum
  name: verificationStatus
  description: Indicates whether this channel has been verified or not. On a ListNotificationChannels
    or GetNotificationChannel operation, this field is expected to be populated.If
    the value is UNVERIFIED, then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning
    (it both requires verification and lacks verification); otherwise, it is assumed
    that the channel works.If the channel is neither VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED, it
    implies that the channel is of a type that does not require verification or
    that this specific channel has been exempted from verification because it was
    created prior to verification being required for channels of this type.This
    field cannot be modified using a standard UpdateNotificationChannel operation.
    To change the value of this field, you must call VerifyNotificationChannel.
  output: true
  values:
  - :VERIFICATION_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED
  - :UNVERIFIED
  - :VERIFIED
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
  name: type
  required: true
  description: The type of the notification channel. This field matches the value
    of the NotificationChannelDescriptor.type field. See
    https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list
    to get the list of valid values such as "email", "slack", etc...
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::KeyValuePairs
  name: userLabels
  description: User-supplied key/value data that does not need to conform to the
    corresponding NotificationChannelDescriptor's schema, unlike the labels field.
    This field is intended to be used for organizing and identifying the NotificationChannel
    objects.The field can contain up to 64 entries. Each key and value is limited
    to 63 Unicode characters or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values
    can contain only lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys
    must begin with a letter.
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
  name: description
  description: An optional human-readable description of this notification channel.
    This description may provide additional details, beyond the display name, for
    the channel. This may not exceed 1024 Unicode characters.
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
  name: displayName
  description: An optional human-readable name for this notification channel. It
    is recommended that you specify a non-empty and unique name in order to make
    it easier to identify the channels in your project, though this is not enforced.
    The display name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
  name: enabled
  default_value: true
  send_empty_value: true
  description: Whether notifications are forwarded to the described channel. This
    makes it possible to disable delivery of notifications to a particular channel
    without removing the channel from all alerting policies that reference the channel.
    This is a more convenient approach when the change is temporary and you want
    to receive notifications from the same set of alerting policies on the channel
    at some point in the future.
