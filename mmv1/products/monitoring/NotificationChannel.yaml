description: |
  A NotificationChannel is a medium through which an alert is delivered
  when a policy violation is detected. Examples of channels include email, SMS,
  and third-party messaging applications. Fields containing sensitive information
  like authentication tokens or contact info are only partially populated on retrieval.

  Notification Channels are designed to be flexible and are made up of a supported `type`
  and labels to configure that channel. Each `type` has specific labels that need to be
  present for that channel to be correctly configured. The labels that are required to be
  present for one channel `type` are often different than those required for another.
  Due to these loose constraints it's often best to set up a channel through the UI
  and import to Terraform when setting up a brand new channel type to determine which
  labels are required.

  A list of supported channels per project the `list` endpoint can be
  accessed programmatically or through the api explorer at  https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.notificationChannelDescriptors/list .
  This provides the channel type and all of the required labels that must be passed.

      If true, the notification channel will be deleted regardless
      of its use in alert policies (the policies will be updated
      to remove the channel). If false, channels that are still
      referenced by an existing alerting policy will fail to be
      deleted in a delete operation.

    description: |
      Configuration fields that define the channel and its behavior. The
      permissible and required labels are specified in the
      NotificationChannelDescriptor corresponding to the type field.

      Labels with sensitive data are obfuscated by the API and therefore Terraform cannot
      determine if there are upstream changes to these fields. They can also be configured via
      the sensitive_labels block, but cannot be configured in both places.

    description: |
      Different notification type behaviors are configured primarily using the the `labels` field on this
      resource. This block contains the labels which contain secrets or passwords so that they can be marked
      sensitive and hidden from plan output. The name of the field, eg: password, will be the key
      in the `labels` map in the api request.

      Credentials may not be specified in both locations and will cause an error. Changing from one location
      to a different credential configuration in the config will require an apply to update state.

      that the channel is non-functioning (it both requires verification and
      lacks verification); otherwise, it is assumed that the channel works.If
      the channel is neither VERIFIED nor UNVERIFIED, it implies that the
      channel is of a type that does not require verification or that this
      specific channel has been exempted from verification because it was
      created prior to verification being required for channels of this
      type.This field cannot be modified using a standard
      UpdateNotificationChannel operation. To change the value of this field,
      you must call VerifyNotificationChannel.

    description:
      An optional human-readable name for this notification channel. It is
      recommended that you specify a non-empty and unique name in order to make

    description:
      Whether notifications are forwarded to the described channel. This makes
      it possible to disable delivery of notifications to a particular channel
      without removing the channel from all alerting policies that reference the
      channel. This is a more convenient approach when the change is temporary
      and you want to receive notifications from the same set of alerting
      policies on the channel at some point in the future.
