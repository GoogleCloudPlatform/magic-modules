      The metric type, including its DNS name prefix. The type is not

      name, in the format of {service name}/{relative metric name}, such as
      cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/cpu/utilization. The relative metric name
      must have only upper and lower-case letters, digits, '/' and underscores
      '_' are allowed. Additionally, the maximum number of characters allowed
      for the relative_metric_name is 100. All user-defined metric types have
      the DNS name custom.googleapis.com, external.googleapis.com, or
      logging.googleapis.com/user/.

    name: unit
    immutable: true
    description: |
      The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only applicable if the
      valueType is INT64, DOUBLE, or DISTRIBUTION. The unit defines the representation of
      the stored metric values.

      Different systems may scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value of
      0.02KBy might be displayed as 20By, and a value of 3523KBy might be displayed as
      3.5MBy). However, if the unit is KBy, then the value of the metric is always in
      thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be displayed.

      If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of CPU-seconds used by a job,
      you can create an INT64 CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is s{CPU} (or equivalently
      1s{CPU} or just s). If the job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as
      12005.

      Alternatively, if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you
      can create a DOUBLE CUMULATIVE metric whose unit is ks{CPU}, and then write the value
      12.005 (which is 12005/1000), or use Kis{CPU} and write 11.723 (which is 12005/1024).
      The supported units are a subset of The Unified Code for Units of Measure standard.
