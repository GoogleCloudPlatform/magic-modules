          The resource name of a ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Note, created by the
          user. If the Note is in a different project from the Attestor, it
          should be specified in the format `projects/*/notes/*` (or the legacy
          `providers/*/notes/*`). This field may not be updated.
          An attestation by this attestor is stored as a Container Analysis
          ATTESTATION_AUTHORITY Occurrence that names a container image
          and that links to this Note.

          If this field is non-empty, one of the specified public keys must
          verify that an attestation was signed by this attestor for the
          image specified in the admission request.
          If this field is empty, this attestor always returns that no valid
          attestations exist.

                must include the ID of the public key that can be used to
                verify them, and that ID must match the contents of this
                field exactly. Additional restrictions on this field can
                be imposed based on which public key type is encapsulated.

                ASCII-armored representation of a PGP public key, as the
                entire output by the command
                `gpg --export --armor foo@example.com` (either LF or CRLF
                line endings). When using this field, id should be left
                blank. The BinAuthz API handlers will calculate the ID
                and fill it in automatically. BinAuthz computes this ID
                as the OpenPGP RFC4880 V4 fingerprint, represented as
                upper-case hex. If id is provided by the caller, it will
                be overwritten by the API-calculated ID.

                NOTE: id may be explicitly provided by the caller when using this
                type of public key, but it MUST be a valid RFC3986 URI. If id is left
                blank, a default one will be computed based on the digest of the DER
                encoding of the public key.

          This field will contain the service account email address that
          this Attestor will use as the principal when querying Container
          Analysis. Attestor administrators must grant this service account
          the IAM role needed to read attestations from the noteReference in
          Container Analysis (containeranalysis.notes.occurrences.viewer).
          This email address is fixed for the lifetime of the Attestor, but
          callers should not make any other assumptions about the service
          account email; future versions may use an email based on a
          different naming pattern.
