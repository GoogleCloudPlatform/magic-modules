        for common system-level images. Images not covered by the global
        policy will be subject to the project admission policy.

        A whitelist of image patterns to exclude from admission rules. If an
        image's name matches a whitelist pattern, the image's admission
        requests will always be permitted regardless of your admission rules.

              An image name pattern to whitelist, in the form

        Per-cluster admission rules. An admission rule specifies either that
        all container images used in a pod creation request must be attested
        to by one or more attestors, that all pod creations will be allowed,
        or that all pod creations will be denied. There can be at most one
        admission rule per cluster spec.


        Identifier format: `{{location}}.{{clusterId}}`.
        A location is either a compute zone (e.g. `us-central1-a`) or a region
        (e.g. `us-central1`).
