description: |
  Allows configuring a single GCP resource that should be inside the `status` block of a service perimeter.
  This resource is intended to be used in cases where it is not possible to compile a full list
  of projects to include in a `google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter` resource,
  to enable them to be added separately.
  If your perimeter is in dry-run mode use `google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter_dry_run_resource` instead.

  ~> **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter` resource,
  the service perimeter resource must have a `lifecycle` block with `ignore_changes = [status[0].resources]` so
  they don't fight over which resources should be in the policy.

  warning: |
    If you are using User ADCs (Application Default Credentials) with this resource,
    you must specify a `billing_project` and set `user_project_override` to true
    in the provider configuration. Otherwise the ACM API will return a 403 error.
    Your account must have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on the
    `billing_project` you defined.
