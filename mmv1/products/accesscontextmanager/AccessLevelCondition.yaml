description: |
  Allows configuring a single access level condition to be appended to an access level's conditions.
  This resource is intended to be used in cases where it is not possible to compile a full list
  of conditions to include in a `google_access_context_manager_access_level` resource,
  to enable them to be added separately.

  ~> **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `google_access_context_manager_access_level` resource,
  the access level resource must have a `lifecycle` block with `ignore_changes = [basic[0].conditions]` so
  they don't fight over which service accounts should be included.

  warning: |
    If you are using User ADCs (Application Default Credentials) with this resource,
    you must specify a `billing_project` and set `user_project_override` to true
    in the provider configuration. Otherwise the ACM API will return a 403 error.
    Your account must have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on the
    `billing_project` you defined.

    description: |
      A list of CIDR block IP subnetwork specification. May be IPv4
      or IPv6.
      Note that for a CIDR IP address block, the specified IP address
      portion must be properly truncated (i.e. all the host bits must
      be zero) or the input is considered malformed. For example,
      "192.0.2.0/24" is accepted but "192.0.2.1/24" is not. Similarly,
      for IPv6, "2001:db8::/32" is accepted whereas "2001:db8::1/32"
      is not. The originating IP of a request must be in one of the
      listed subnets in order for this Condition to be true.
      If empty, all IP addresses are allowed.
