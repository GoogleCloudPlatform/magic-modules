  ServicePerimeter describes a set of GCP resources which can freely import
  and export data amongst themselves, but not export outside of the
  ServicePerimeter. If a request with a source within this ServicePerimeter
  has a target outside of the ServicePerimeter, the request will be blocked.
  Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two types of Service Perimeter
  - Regular and Bridge. Regular Service Perimeters cannot overlap, a single
  GCP project can only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter. Service
  Perimeter Bridges can contain only GCP projects as members, a single GCP
  project may belong to multiple Service Perimeter Bridges.

    If you are using User ADCs (Application Default Credentials) with this resource,
    you must specify a `billing_project` and set `user_project_override` to true
    in the provider configuration. Otherwise the ACM API will return a 403 error.
    Your account must have the `serviceusage.services.use` permission on the
    `billing_project` you defined.

    description: |
      Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and
      bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels,
      and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
      ONE regular Service Perimeter.

      In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
      be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
      resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
      resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
      Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
      entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.

      Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
      topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
      with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
      themselves.

    description: |
      Use explicit dry run spec flag. Ordinarily, a dry-run spec implicitly exists
      for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those
      Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
      implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
      configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
      This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
      actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
      between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
      bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.
