      AccessPolicy is a container for AccessLevels (which define the necessary
      attributes to use GCP services) and ServicePerimeters (which define
      regions of services able to freely pass data within a perimeter). An
      access policy is globally visible within an organization, and the
      restrictions it specifies apply to all projects within an organization.

      ServicePerimeter describes a set of GCP resources which can freely import
      and export data amongst themselves, but not export outside of the
      ServicePerimeter. If a request with a source within this ServicePerimeter
      has a target outside of the ServicePerimeter, the request will be blocked.
      Otherwise the request is allowed. There are two types of Service Perimeter
      - Regular and Bridge. Regular Service Perimeters cannot overlap, a single
      GCP project can only belong to a single regular Service Perimeter. Service
      Perimeter Bridges can contain only GCP projects as members, a single GCP
      project may belong to multiple Service Perimeter Bridges.

          Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and
          bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels,
          and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
          ONE regular Service Perimeter.

          In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
          be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
          resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
          resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
          Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
          entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.

          Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
          topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
          with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
          themselves.

          for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those
          Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
          implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
          configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
          This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
          actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
          between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
          bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.

                Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and
                bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels,
                and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
                ONE regular Service Perimeter.

                In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
                be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
                resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
                resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
                Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
                entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.

                Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
                topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
                with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
                themselves.

                Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
                implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
                configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
                This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
                actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
                between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must

      the service perimeter resource must have a `lifecycle` block with `ignore_changes = [status[0].resources]` so
      they don't fight over which resources should be in the policy.
