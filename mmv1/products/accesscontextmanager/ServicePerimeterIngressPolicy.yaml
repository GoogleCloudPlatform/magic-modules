  IngressPolicies match requests based on ingressFrom and ingressTo stanzas. For an ingress policy to match,
  both the ingressFrom and ingressTo stanzas must be matched. If an IngressPolicy matches a request,
  the request is allowed through the perimeter boundary from outside the perimeter.
  For example, access from the internet can be allowed either based on an AccessLevel or,
  for traffic hosted on Google Cloud, the project of the source network.
  For access from private networks, using the project of the hosting network is required.
  Individual ingress policies can be limited by restricting which services and/
  or actions they match using the ingressTo field.

  ~> **Note:** By default, updates to this resource will remove the IngressPolicy from the
  from the perimeter and add it back in a non-atomic manner. To ensure that the new IngressPolicy
  is added before the old one is removed, add a `lifecycle` block with `create_before_destroy = true` to this resource.

              description: |
                An `AccessLevel` resource name that allow resources within the
                `ServicePerimeters` to be accessed from the internet. `AccessLevels` listed
                must be in the same policy as this `ServicePerimeter`. Referencing a nonexistent
                `AccessLevel` will cause an error. If no `AccessLevel` names are listed,
                resources within the perimeter can only be accessed via Google Cloud calls
                with request origins within the perimeter.
                Example `accessPolicies/MY_POLICY/accessLevels/MY_LEVEL.`
                If * is specified, then all IngressSources will be allowed.

                A Google Cloud resource that is allowed to ingress the perimeter.
                Requests from these resources will be allowed to access perimeter data.
                Currently only projects are allowed. Format `projects/{project_number}`
                The project may be in any Google Cloud organization, not just the
                organization that the perimeter is defined in. `*` is not allowed, the case
                of allowing all Google Cloud resources only is not supported.

        description: |
          A list of resources, currently only projects in the form
          `projects/<projectnumber>`, protected by this `ServicePerimeter`
          that are allowed to be accessed by sources defined in the
          corresponding `IngressFrom`. A request matches if it contains
          a resource in this list. If `*` is specified for resources,
          then this `IngressTo` rule will authorize access to all
          resources inside the perimeter, provided that the request
          also matches the `operations` field.
