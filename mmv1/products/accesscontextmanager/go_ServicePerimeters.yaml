  Replace all existing Service Perimeters in an Access Policy with the Service Perimeters provided. This is done atomically.
  This is a bulk edit of all Service Perimeters and may override existing Service Perimeters created by `google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter`,
  thus causing a permadiff if used alongside `google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter` on the same parent.

            Specifies the type of the Perimeter. There are two types: regular and
            bridge. Regular Service Perimeter contains resources, access levels,
            and restricted services. Every resource can be in at most
            ONE regular Service Perimeter.

            In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
            be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
            resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
            resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
            Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
            entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.

            Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
            topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
            with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among
            themselves.

            Use explicit dry run spec flag. Ordinarily, a dry-run spec implicitly exists
            for all Service Perimeters, and that spec is identical to the status for those
            Service Perimeters. When this flag is set, it inhibits the generation of the
            implicit spec, thereby allowing the user to explicitly provide a
            configuration ("spec") to use in a dry-run version of the Service Perimeter.
            This allows the user to test changes to the enforced config ("status") without
            actually enforcing them. This testing is done through analyzing the differences
            between currently enforced and suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must
            bet set to True if any of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.
