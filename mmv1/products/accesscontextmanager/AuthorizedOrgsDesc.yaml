    description: |
      The direction of the authorization relationship between this organization
      and the organizations listed in the "orgs" field. The valid values for this
      field include the following:

      AUTHORIZATION_DIRECTION_FROM: Allows this organization to evaluate traffic
      in the organizations listed in the `orgs` field.

      AUTHORIZATION_DIRECTION_TO: Allows the organizations listed in the `orgs`
      field to evaluate the traffic in this organization.

      For the authorization relationship to take effect, all of the organizations
      must authorize and specify the appropriate relationship direction. For
      example, if organization A authorized organization B and C to evaluate its
      traffic, by specifying "AUTHORIZATION_DIRECTION_TO" as the authorization
      direction, organizations B and C must specify
      "AUTHORIZATION_DIRECTION_FROM" as the authorization direction in their
      "AuthorizedOrgsDesc" resource.
