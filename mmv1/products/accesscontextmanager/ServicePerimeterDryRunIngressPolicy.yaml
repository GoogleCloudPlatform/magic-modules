name: 'ServicePerimeterDryRunIngressPolicy'
api_resource_type_kind: ServicePerimeter
description: |
  Manage a single IngressPolicy in the spec (dry-run) configuration for a service perimeter.
  IngressPolicies match requests based on ingressFrom and ingressTo stanzas. For an ingress policy to match,
  both the ingressFrom and ingressTo stanzas must be matched. If an IngressPolicy matches a request,
  the request is allowed through the perimeter boundary from outside the perimeter.
  For example, access from the internet can be allowed either based on an AccessLevel or,
  for traffic hosted on Google Cloud, the project of the source network.
  For access from private networks, using the project of the hosting network is required.
  Individual ingress policies can be limited by restricting which services and/
  or actions they match using the ingressTo field.

  ~> **Note:** By default, updates to this resource will remove the IngressPolicy from the
  from the perimeter and add it back in a non-atomic manner. To ensure that the new IngressPolicy
  is added before the old one is removed, add a `lifecycle` block with `create_before_destroy = true` to this resource.
  ~> **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter` resource,
  the service perimeter resource must have a `lifecycle` block with `ignore_changes = [spec[0].ingress_policies]` so
  they don't fight over which ingress rules should be in the policy.

      The perimeter etag is internally used to prevent overwriting the list of policies on PATCH calls. It is retrieved from the same GET perimeter API call that's used to get the current list of policies. The policy defined in this resource is added or removed from that list, and then this etag is sent with the PATCH call along with the updated policies.
