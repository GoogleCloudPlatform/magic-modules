## 0.7.3.pre1 / 2014-08-20

This release includes compatibility fixes for different ruby versions
and some minor enhancements.

*   C Extensions are only compiled on MRI 1.9.x.

    For MRI >= 2 the native API is used, so this should speedup
    installation.

    For JRuby this will avoid crashes on gem installation.

    This was alredy being checked for Rubinius.

    *Amadeus Folego*

*    Added experimental JRuby support for 1.7.x series.

     Only the main API is implemented and `Binding#eval` is
     monkey-patched as it is private on JRuby.

     This requires the compiler to be run on interpreted mode,
     otherwise an exception will be thrown when `of_caller` is called.

    *Charles Nutter*

*   Remove executability from non-executable files.

    *David Celis*

*   Test and notice MRI 2.1 as a working Ruby implementation.

    *Lennart Frid√©n*
