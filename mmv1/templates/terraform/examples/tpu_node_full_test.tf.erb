  We previously used the first available version from the
  google_tpu_tensorflow_versions data source. However, this started to return a
  random set of versions which caused our tests to occasionally fail, so we pin
  tensorflow_version to a specific version so that our tests pass reliably.

  We previously used a separate network resource here, but TPUs only allow using 50
  different network names, ever. This caused our tests to start failing, so just
  use the default network in order to still demonstrate using as many fields as
  possible on the resource.
