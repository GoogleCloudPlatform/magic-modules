// This resource is unusual - instead of returning an Operation from
// Create, it returns the created object itself.  We don't parse
// any of the values there, preferring to centralize that logic in
// Read().  In this resource, Read is also unusual - it requires
// us to know the server-side generated name of the object we're
// trying to fetch, and the only way to know that is to capture
// it here.  The following two lines do that.
