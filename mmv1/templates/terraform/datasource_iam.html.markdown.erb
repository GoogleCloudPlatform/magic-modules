<%# NOTE NOTE NOTE
    The newlines in this file are *load bearing*.  This file outputs
    Markdown, which is extremely sensitive to newlines.  You have got
    to have a newline after every attribute and property, because
    otherwise MD will think the next element is part of the previous
    property's bullet point.  You cannot have any double newlines in the
    middle of a property or attribute, because MD will think that the
    empty line ends the bullet point and the indentation will be off.
    You must have a newline before and after all --- document indicators,
    and you must have a newline before and after all - - - hlines.
    You cannot have more than one blank line between properties.
    The --- document indicator must be the first line of the file.
    As long as you only use `build_property_documentation`, it all works
    fine - but when you need to add custom docs (notes, etc), you need
    to remember these things.

    Know also that the `lines` function in heavy use in MagicModules will
    strip exactly one trailing newline - unless that's what you've designed
    your docstring for, it's easier to insert newlines where you need them
    manually.  That's why, in this file, we use `lines` on anything which
    is generated from a ruby function, but skip it on anything that is
    directly inserted from YAML.

Retrieves the current IAM policy data for <%= object.name.downcase -%>

~> **Warning:** This datasource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

<% url_properties.each do |param| -%>
<% if param.name == "name" -%>
* `<%= object.iam_policy.parent_resource_attribute || object.name.underscore -%>` - (Required) Used to find the parent resource to bind the IAM policy to
<% elsif ["region", "zone"].include?(param.name.underscore) -%>
* `<%= param.name.underscore -%>` - (Optional) <%= param.description -%> Used to find the parent resource to bind the IAM policy to. If not specified,
  the value will be parsed from the identifier of the parent resource. If no <%= param.name.underscore -%> is provided in the parent identifier and no
  <%= param.name.underscore -%> is specified, it is taken from the provider configuration.
<% else -%>
* `<%= param.name.underscore -%>` - (Required) <%= param.description -%> Used to find the parent resource to bind the IAM policy to
<% end -%>
<% end -%>
<% if object.iam_policy.base_url.present? -%>
<% if object.iam_policy.base_url.include?("{{project}}") -%>
<%# The following new line allow for project to be bullet-formatted properly. -%>

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the project will be parsed from the identifier of the parent resource. If no project is provided in the parent identifier and no project is specified, the provider project is used.
<% end -%>
<% elsif object.base_url.include?("{{project}}")-%>
<%# The following new line allow for project to be bullet-formatted properly. -%>

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the project will be parsed from the identifier of the parent resource. If no project is provided in the parent identifier and no project is specified, the provider project is used.
<% end -%>

## Attributes Reference

The attributes are exported:

* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the IAM policy.

* `policy_data` - (Required only by `<%= resource_ns_iam -%>_policy`) The policy data generated by
  a `google_iam_policy` data source.
