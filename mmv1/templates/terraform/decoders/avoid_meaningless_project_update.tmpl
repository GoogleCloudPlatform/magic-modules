  // The problem we're trying to solve here is that this property is a Project,
  // and there are a lot of ways to specify a Project, including the ID vs
  // Number, which is something that we can't address in a diffsuppress.
  // Since we can't enforce a particular method of entering the project,
  // we're just going to have to use whatever the user entered, whether
  // it's project/projectName, project/12345, projectName, or 12345.
  // The normal behavior of this method would be 'return res' - and that's
  // what we'll fall back to if any of our conditions aren't met.  Those
  // conditions are:
  // 1) if the new or old values contain '/', the prefix of that is 'projects'.
  // 2) if either is non-numeric, a project with that ID exists.
  // 3) the project IDs represented by both the new and old values are the same.
