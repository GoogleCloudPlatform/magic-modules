# google_compute_reservation_hosts

List Google Compute Engine Hosts in a zone, optionally scoped to a reservation, reservation block, or reservation sub-block.

For more information see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/reserving-zonal-resources)
and the [API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/hosts/list).

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "google_compute_reservation_hosts" "hosts" {
  reservation = "my-reservation"
  zone        = "us-central1-a"
}

output "host_names" {
  value = [for h in data.google_compute_reservation_hosts.hosts.hosts : h.name]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `reservation` - (Optional) The name of the parent reservation. When omitted, lists hosts from the top-level zonal `/hosts` collection.

* `reservation_block` - (Optional) The name of the parent reservation block. Requires `reservation` to be set.

* `reservation_sub_block` - (Optional) The name of the parent reservation sub-block. Requires `reservation` and `reservation_block` to be set.

* `filter` - (Optional) A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.

* `zone` - (Optional) The zone where the hosts reside. If it is not provided, the provider zone is used.

* `project` - (Optional) The project in which the resource belongs. If it is not provided, the provider project is used.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - The identifier for the data source with format `projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/hosts` or `projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/{{association}}/hosts`.

* `hosts` - A list of matching host objects. Structure is [documented below](#nested_hosts).

<a name="nested_hosts"></a>The `hosts` block contains:

* `name` - The name of the host.

* `kind` - Type of the resource. Always `compute#host` for hosts.

* `resource_id` - The unique server-generated identifier for the host.

* `creation_timestamp` - Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

* `zone` - The zone in which the host resides.

* `self_link` - Server-defined fully-qualified URL for this resource.

* `self_link_with_id` - Server-defined URL for this resource with the resource ID.

* `alias_links` - All alias resource paths for this host.

* `state` - The state of the host (for example, `CREATING`, `ACTIVE`, `DELETING`, or `UNAVAILABLE`).

* `status` - The status of the host. Structure is [documented below](#nested_status).

<a name="nested_status"></a>The `status` block contains:

* `physical_topology` - The physical topology of the host, if present. Structure is [documented below](#nested_physical_topology).

* `running_instances` - The URIs of the instances currently running on this host.

<a name="nested_physical_topology"></a>The `physical_topology` block contains:

* `cluster` - The cluster name of the reservation sub-block.

* `block` - The unique identifier of the capacity block within the cluster.

* `sub_block` - The unique identifier of the capacity sub-block within the capacity block.

* `host` - The unique identifier of the capacity host within the capacity sub-block.
