## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `boot_disk` - (Required) The boot disk for the instance.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_boot_disk).

* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the resource, required by GCE.
    Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `zone` - (Optional) The zone that the machine should be created in. If it is not provided, the provider zone is used.

* `network_interface` - (Required) Networks to attach to the instance. This can
    be specified multiple times. Structure is [documented below](#nested_network_interface).

    On the instance, this device will be `/dev/disk/by-id/google-{{device_name}}`.

* `mode` - (Optional) The mode in which to attach this disk, either `READ_WRITE`
  or `READ_ONLY`. If not specified, the default is to attach the disk in `READ_WRITE` mode.

* `disk_encryption_key_raw` - (Optional) A 256-bit [customer-supplied encryption key]
    (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/customer-supplied-encryption),
    encoded in [RFC 4648 base64](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4)
    to encrypt this disk. Only one of `kms_key_self_link` and `disk_encryption_key_raw`
    may be set.

* `kms_key_self_link` - (Optional) The self_link of the encryption key that is
    stored in Google Cloud KMS to encrypt this disk. Only one of `kms_key_self_link`
    and `disk_encryption_key_raw` may be set.

* `initialize_params` - (Optional) Parameters for a new disk that will be created
    alongside the new instance. Either `initialize_params` or `source` must be set.
    Structure is [documented below](#nested_initialize_params).

* `source` - (Optional) The name or self_link of the existing disk (such as those managed by
    `google_compute_disk`) or disk image. To create an instance from a snapshot, first create a
    `google_compute_disk` from a snapshot and reference it here.

<a name="nested_initialize_params"></a>The `initialize_params` block supports:

* `size` - (Optional) The size of the image in gigabytes. If not specified, it
    will inherit the size of its base image.

* `type` - (Optional) The GCE disk type. Such as pd-standard, pd-balanced or pd-ssd.

* `image` - (Optional) The image from which to initialize this disk. This can be
    one of: the image's `self_link`, `projects/{project}/global/images/{image}`,
    `projects/{project}/global/images/family/{family}`, `global/images/{image}`,
    `global/images/family/{family}`, `family/{family}`, `{project}/{family}`,
    `{project}/{image}`, `{family}`, or `{image}`. If referred by family, the
    images names must include the family name. If they don't, use the
    [google_compute_image data source](/docs/providers/google/d/compute_image.html).
    For instance, the image `centos-6-v20180104` includes its family name `centos-6`.
    These images can be referred by family name here.

* `labels` - (Optional) A set of key/value label pairs assigned to the disk. This
    field is only applicable for persistent disks.

* `resource_manager_tags` - (Optional) A tag is a key-value pair that can be attached to a Google Cloud resource. You can use tags to conditionally allow or deny policies based on whether a resource has a specific tag. This value is not returned by the API. In Terraform, this value cannot be updated and changing it will recreate the resource.

* `provisioned_iops` - (Optional) Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk.
    This sets the number of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle.
    For more details,see the [Hyperdisk documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/hyperdisks).
    Note: Updating currently is only supported for hyperdisk skus via disk update
    api/gcloud without the need to delete and recreate the disk, hyperdisk allows
    for an update of IOPS every 4 hours. To update your hyperdisk more frequently,
    you'll need to manually delete and recreate it.

* `provisioned_throughput` - (Optional) Indicates how much throughput to provision for the disk.
    This sets the number of throughput mb per second that the disk can handle.
    For more details,see the [Hyperdisk documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/hyperdisks).
    Note: Updating currently is only supported for hyperdisk skus via disk update
    api/gcloud without the need to delete and recreate the disk, hyperdisk allows
    for an update of throughput every 4 hours. To update your hyperdisk more
    frequently, you'll need to manually delete and recreate it.

    interface to. Either `network` or `subnetwork` must be provided. If network isn't provided
    it will be inferred from the subnetwork. The subnetwork must exist in the same region this
    instance will be created in. If the network resource is in
    [legacy](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/legacy) mode, do not specify this field. If the
