      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
        name: alternativeLocationId
        description: |
          Only applicable to STANDARD_HA tier which protects the instance
          against zonal failures by provisioning it across two zones.
          If provided, it must be a different zone from the one provided in
          [locationId].
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
        name: authorizedNetwork
        description: |
          The full name of the Google Compute Engine network to which the
          instance is connected. If left unspecified, the default network
          will be used.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Time
        name: createTime
        description: |
          The time the instance was created in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format,
          accurate to nanoseconds.

      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
        name: currentLocationId
        description: |
          The current zone where the Redis endpoint is placed.
          For Basic Tier instances, this will always be the same as the
          [locationId] provided by the user at creation time. For Standard Tier
          instances, this can be either [locationId] or [alternativeLocationId]
          and can change after a failover event.
        output: true
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String

        name: locationId
        description: |
          The zone where the instance will be provisioned. If not provided,
          the service will choose a zone for the instance. For STANDARD_HA tier,
          instances will be created across two zones for protection against
          zonal failures. If [alternativeLocationId] is also provided, it must
          be different from [locationId].
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String

        name: reservedIpRange
        description: |
          The CIDR range of internal addresses that are reserved for this
          instance. If not provided, the service will choose an unused /29
          block, for example, 10.0.0.0/29 or 192.168.0.0/29. Ranges must be
          unique and non-overlapping with existing subnets in an authorized
