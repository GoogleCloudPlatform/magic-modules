        description: |
          Data transfer schedule. If the data source does not support a custom
          schedule, this should be empty. If it is empty, the default value for
          the data source will be used. The specified times are in UTC. Examples
          of valid format: 1st,3rd monday of month 15:30, every wed,fri of jan,
          jun 13:15, and first sunday of quarter 00:00. See more explanation

          NOTE: the granularity should be at least 8 hours, or less frequent.

          For example, if dataRefreshWindowDays = 10, then every day BigQuery
          reingests data for [today-10, today-1], rather than ingesting data for
          just [today-1]. Only valid if the data source supports the feature.
          Set the value to 0 to use the default value.
