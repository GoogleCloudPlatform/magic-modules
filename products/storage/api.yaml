      The Buckets resource represents a bucket in Google Cloud Storage. There is
      a single global namespace shared by all buckets. For more information, see
      Bucket Name Requirements.

      Buckets contain objects which can be accessed by their own methods. In
      addition to the acl property, buckets contain bucketAccessControls, for
      use in fine-grained manipulation of an existing bucket's access controls.

      A bucket is always owned by the project team owners group.

      The BucketAccessControls resource represents the Access Control Lists
      (ACLs) for buckets within Google Cloud Storage. ACLs let you specify who
      has access to your data and to what extent.

      There are three roles that can be assigned to an entity:

      READERs can get the bucket, though no acl property will be returned, and
      list the bucket's objects.  WRITERs are READERs, and they can insert
      objects into the bucket and delete the bucket's objects.  OWNERs are
      WRITERs, and they can get the acl property of a bucket, update a bucket,
      and call all BucketAccessControls methods on the bucket.  For more
      information, see Access Control, with the caveat that this API uses
      READER, WRITER, and OWNER instead of READ, WRITE, and FULL_CONTROL.
