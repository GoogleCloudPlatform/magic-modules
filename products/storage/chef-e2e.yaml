# TODO(nelsonjr): Change all objects so each test run in parallel: between same
# provider (e.g. DNS managed zone vs. record set) and across provides (e.g.
# Puppet compute address vs. Chef compute address). Once this is done make all
# tests run completely in parallel.

# TODO(alexstephen): Separate plan.yaml and move to products/
