              Endpoint configuration attributes.

              Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can
              be used to control different aspects of the message delivery.

              The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you
              can use to change the format of the pushed message. This
              attribute indicates the version of the data expected by
              the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message
              (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
              based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.

              If not present during the subscriptions.create call,
              it will default to the version of the API used to make
              such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig
              call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get
              calls will always return a valid version, even if the
              subscription was created without this attribute.

              The possible values for this attribute are:

              - v1beta1: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.
              - v1 or v1beta2: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
        name: 'ackDeadlineSeconds'
        description: |
          This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message
          before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message
          delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is
          acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered
          again during that time (on a best-effort basis).

          For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for
          the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
          subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
          pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
          maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
          If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.

          For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
          for the call to the push endpoint.

          If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system
          will eventually redeliver the message.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
        name: 'messageRetentionDuration'
        default_value: '604800s'
        description: |
          How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the subscription's
          backlog, from the moment a message is published. If
          retainAckedMessages is true, then this also configures the retention
          of acknowledged messages, and thus configures how far back in time a
          subscriptions.seek can be done. Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more
          than 7 days (`"604800s"`) or less than 10 minutes (`"600s"`).

          A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated
          by 's'. Example: `"600.5s"`.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
        name: 'retainAckedMessages'
        description: |
          Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If `true`, then
          messages are not expunged from the subscription's backlog, even if
          they are acknowledged, until they fall out of the
          messageRetentionDuration window.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::NestedObject
        name: 'expirationPolicy'
        allow_empty_object: true
        send_empty_value: true
        description: |
          A policy that specifies the conditions for this subscription's expiration.
          A subscription is considered active as long as any connected subscriber
          is successfully consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing
          operations on the subscription. If expirationPolicy is not set, a default
          policy with ttl of 31 days will be used. The minimum allowed value for
          expirationPolicy.ttl is 1 day.
        properties:
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
            name: 'ttl'
            description: |
              Specifies the "time-to-live" duration for an associated resource. The
              resource expires if it is not active for a period of ttl. The definition
              of "activity" depends on the type of the associated resource. The minimum
              and maximum allowed values for ttl depend on the type of the associated
              resource, as well. If ttl is not set, the associated resource never expires.
              A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, terminated by 's'.
              Example - "3.5s".
