        description: |
          If push delivery is used with this subscription, this field is used to
          configure it. An empty pushConfig signifies that the subscriber will
          pull and ack messages using API methods.
        properties:
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
            name: 'pushEndpoint'
            description: |
              A URL locating the endpoint to which messages should be pushed.
              For example, a Webhook endpoint might use
              "https://example.com/push".
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
        name: 'ackDeadlineSeconds'
        description: |
          This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message
          before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message
          delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is
          acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered
          again during that time (on a best-effort basis).

          For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for
          the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
          subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
          pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
          maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
          If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.

          For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
          for the call to the push endpoint.

          If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system
          will eventually redeliver the message.
