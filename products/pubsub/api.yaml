              Endpoint configuration attributes.

              Every endpoint has a set of API supported attributes that can
              be used to control different aspects of the message delivery.

              The currently supported attribute is x-goog-version, which you
              can use to change the format of the pushed message. This
              attribute indicates the version of the data expected by
              the endpoint. This controls the shape of the pushed message
              (i.e., its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is
              based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.

              If not present during the subscriptions.create call,
              it will default to the version of the API used to make
              such call. If not present during a subscriptions.modifyPushConfig
              call, its value will not be changed. subscriptions.get
              calls will always return a valid version, even if the
              subscription was created without this attribute.

              The possible values for this attribute are:

              - v1beta1: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API.
              - v1 or v1beta2: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
        name: 'ackDeadlineSeconds'
        description: |
          This value is the maximum time after a subscriber receives a message
          before the subscriber should acknowledge the message. After message
          delivery but before the ack deadline expires and before the message is
          acknowledged, it is an outstanding message and will not be delivered
          again during that time (on a best-effort basis).

          For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial value for
          the ack deadline. To override this value for a given message, call
          subscriptions.modifyAckDeadline with the corresponding ackId if using
          pull. The minimum custom deadline you can specify is 10 seconds. The
          maximum custom deadline you can specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes).
          If this parameter is 0, a default value of 10 seconds is used.

          For push delivery, this value is also used to set the request timeout
          for the call to the push endpoint.

          If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the Pub/Sub system
          will eventually redeliver the message.
