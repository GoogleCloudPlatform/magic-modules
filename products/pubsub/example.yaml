  # All of these files will be copied verbatim.
  copy:

  # These files have templating (ERB) code that will be run.
  # This is usually to add licensing info, autogeneration notices, etc.

# This is for custom testing code. All of our tests follow a specific pattern
# that sometimes needs to be deviated from. We're working towards a world where
# these handwritten tests would be unnecessary in many cases (custom types).
