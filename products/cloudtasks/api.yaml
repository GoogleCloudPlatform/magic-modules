              By default, the task is sent to the service which is the default service when the task is attempted.

        name: 'rateLimits'
        description: |
          Rate limits for task dispatches. 

          The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of:

          * Number of tasks in the queue
          * User-specified throttling: rateLimits, retryConfig, and the queue's state.
          * System throttling due to 429 (Too Many Requests) or 503 (Service
            Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to
            smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
        properties:
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
            name: 'maxDispatchesPerSecond'
            description: |
              The maximum rate at which tasks are dispatched from this queue.

              If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick the default.
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
            name: 'maxConcurrentDispatches'
            description: |
              The maximum number of concurrent tasks that Cloud Tasks allows to
              be dispatched for this queue. After this threshold has been
              reached, Cloud Tasks stops dispatching tasks until the number of
              concurrent requests decreases.
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
            name: 'maxBurstSize'
            output: true
            description: |
              The max burst size.

              Max burst size limits how fast tasks in queue are processed when many tasks are
              in the queue and the rate is high. This field allows the queue to have a high
              rate so processing starts shortly after a task is enqueued, but still limits
              resource usage when many tasks are enqueued in a short period of time.

        name: 'retryConfig'

        properties:

            name: 'maxAttempts'
            description: |
              Number of attempts per task.

              Cloud Tasks will attempt the task maxAttempts times (that is, if
              the first attempt fails, then there will be maxAttempts - 1
              retries). Must be >= -1.

              If unspecified when the queue is created, Cloud Tasks will pick
              the default.

              -1 indicates unlimited attempts.
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
            name: 'maxRetryDuration'
            description: |
              If positive, maxRetryDuration specifies the time limit for
              retrying a failed task, measured from when the task was first
              attempted. Once maxRetryDuration time has passed and the task has
              been attempted maxAttempts times, no further attempts will be
              made and the task will be deleted.

              If zero, then the task age is unlimited.
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
            name: 'minBackoff'
            description: |
              A task will be scheduled for retry between minBackoff and
              maxBackoff duration after it fails, if the queue's RetryConfig
              specifies that the task should be retried.

            name: 'maxDoublings'
            description: |
              The time between retries will double maxDoublings times.

              A task's retry interval starts at minBackoff, then doubles maxDoublings times,
              then increases linearly, and finally retries retries at intervals of maxBackoff
              up to maxAttempts times.
