          Minimum slots available to this reservation. A slot is a unit of computational power in BigQuery, and serves as the
          unit of parallelism. Queries using this reservation might use more slots during runtime if ignoreIdleSlots is set to false.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
        name: 'ignoreIdleSlots'
        default_value: false
        description: |
          If false, any query using this reservation will use idle slots from other reservations within
          the same admin project. If true, a query using this reservation will execute with the slot
          capacity specified above at most.
