          ACTIVE: The pool is active, and may be used in Google Cloud policies.
          DELETED: The pool is soft-deleted. Soft-deleted pools are permanently deleted after
          approximately 30 days. You can restore a soft-deleted pool using
          UndeleteWorkloadIdentityPool. You cannot reuse the ID of a soft-deleted pool until it is
          permanently deleted. While a pool is deleted, you cannot use it to exchange tokens, or
          use existing tokens to access resources. If the pool is undeleted, existing tokens grant
          access again.
