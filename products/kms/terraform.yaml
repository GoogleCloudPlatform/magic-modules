      ~> **Note:** KeyRings cannot be deleted from Google Cloud Platform.
      Destroying a Terraform-managed KeyRing will remove it from state but
      *will not delete the resource on the server.*

        name: "kms_key_ring_basic"
        primary_resource_id: "example-keyring"
        # Because we can't really delete the resource, we get an error of
        # dangling resources with the auto generated tests. The hand-written
        # tests do a better job at testing that the key was removed from state
        # and that no keyrings are left behind since they create (and destroy)
        # a project just for this test, but they require org level IAM roles
        # for the test service account.
