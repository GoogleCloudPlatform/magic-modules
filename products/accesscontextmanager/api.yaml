      AccessPolicy is a container for AccessLevels (which define the necessary
      attributes to use GCP services) and ServicePerimeters (which define
      regions of services able to freely pass data within a perimeter). An
      access policy is globally visible within an organization, and the
      restrictions it specifies apply to all projects within an organization.

          ONE regular Service Perimeter.

          In addition to being in a regular service perimeter, a resource can also
          be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A perimeter bridge only contains
          resources. Cross project operations are permitted if all effected
          resources share some perimeter (whether bridge or regular). Perimeter
          Bridge does not contain access levels or services: those are governed
          entirely by the regular perimeter that resource is in.

          Perimeter Bridges are typically useful when building more complex
          topologies with many independent perimeters that need to share some data
          with a common perimeter, but should not be able to share data among

              A list of AccessLevel resource names that allow resources within
              the ServicePerimeter to be accessed from the internet.
              AccessLevels listed must be in the same policy as this
              ServicePerimeter. Referencing a nonexistent AccessLevel is a
              syntax error. If no AccessLevel names are listed, resources within
              the perimeter can only be accessed via GCP calls with request
              origins within the perimeter. For Service Perimeter Bridge, must
              be empty.

              GCP services that are subject to the Service Perimeter
              restrictions. Must contain a list of services. For example, if
              `storage.googleapis.com` is specified, access to the storage
              buckets inside the perimeter must meet the perimeter's access
              restrictions.

      Allows configuring a single GCP resource that should be inside of a service perimeter.
      This resource is intended to be used in cases where it is not possible to compile a full list
      of projects to include in a `google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter` resource,
      to enable them to be added separately.

      ~> **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter` resource,
      the service perimeter resource must have a `lifecycle` block with `ignore_changes = [status[0].resources]` so
      they don't fight over which resources should be in the policy.
