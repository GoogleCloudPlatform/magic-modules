          new tables, not existing ones. When the `expirationTime` for a given

          If a table's `expirationTime` is modified or removed before the

          affect new tables, not existing ones. The storage in a partition will
          have an expiration time of its partition time plus this value.
          Setting this property overrides the use of `defaultTableExpirationMs`
          for partitioned tables: only one of `defaultTableExpirationMs` and
          `defaultPartitionExpirationMs` will be used for any new partitioned
          table. If you provide an explicit `timePartitioning.expirationMs` when

          There are two types of locations, regional or multi-regional. A regional
          location is a specific geographic place, such as Tokyo, and a multi-regional
          location is a large geographic area, such as the United States, that
          contains at least two geographic places.
          
          
          Possible regional values include: `asia-east1`, `asia-northeast1`,
          `asia-southeast1`, `australia-southeast1`, `europe-north1`,
          `europe-west2` and `us-east4`.
          
          
          Possible multi-regional values: `EU` and `US`.


          The default value is multi-regional location `US`.
          Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

      it is not possible to compile a full list of access blocks to include in a
      `google_bigquery_dataset` resource, to enable them to be added separately.

      ~> **Note:** If this resource is used alongside a `google_bigquery_dataset` resource, the
      dataset resource must either have no defined `access` blocks or a `lifecycle` block with
      `ignore_changes = [access]` so they don't fight over which accesses should be on the dataset.
