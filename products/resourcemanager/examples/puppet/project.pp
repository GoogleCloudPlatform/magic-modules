# To create a new project the authenticated user need the privilege to create
# new projects, either standalone or under an organization. This example uses
# the 'application-default' provider, which draws from 'gcloud' (Google Cloud
# SDK tool) the current user credentials.
#
# To make the example work you have to run this command once before applying the
# manifest and follow its instructions:
#
#     gcloud auth application-default login
#
# Alternatively you can setup a service account and use the *preferred*
# 'serviceaccount' provider instead with a JSON key file.

# Project ID needs to be unique. Add a random suffix so they are always
# unique. You should set FACTER_project_suffix, or use any other Puppet
# supported way, to set a global variable $project_suffix.
#
# For example you can define the fact to be an always increasing value:
#
# $ FACTER_project_suffix=$(date +%s) puppet apply examples/project.pp
#
# To be able to delete the project via Puppet make sure the instance ID matches
# the ID used during creation. If you used the create example and specified the
# 'project_suffix', you should match it as well during deletion.
