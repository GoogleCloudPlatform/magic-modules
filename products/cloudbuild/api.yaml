                    The name of the container image that will run this particular build step.

                    If the image is available in the host's Docker daemon's cache, it will be
                    run directly. If not, the host will attempt to pull the image first, using
                    the builder service account's credentials if necessary.

                    The Docker daemon's cache will already have the latest versions of all of
                    the officially supported build steps (https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders).
                    The Docker daemon will also have cached many of the layers for some popular
                    images, like "ubuntu", "debian", but they will be refreshed at the time
                    you attempt to use them.

                    If you built an image in a previous build step, it will be stored in the
                    host's Docker daemon's cache and is available to use as the name for a
                    later build step.

                    are used as arguments to that entrypoint. If the image does not define an
                    entrypoint, the first element in args is used as the entrypoint, and the
                    remainder will be used as arguments.
