# All Virtual objects that are ResourceRefs will not be treated as traditional
# ResourceRefs. Instead, a lookup function will be used. Lookup functions take
# in the name of a specific resource ('region', 'us-west1'), verify the
# object's existence and then return a specific value. It may be the default
# value or a manually specified value.
