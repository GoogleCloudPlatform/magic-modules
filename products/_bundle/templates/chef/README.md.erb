## Description

This cookbook is a convenience to install all Google Cloud Platform cookbooks
for Chef with a single command. You can install them individually if you wish
as well.


## Setup

To install this cookbook, insert the following into your Berksfile.

    cookbook 'google-cloud', '~> <%= manifest.version -%>'

## Supported Google Cloud Platform Products

The `google/cloud` cookbook installs the following cookbooks automatically:

<%=
  lines(indent(products.keys.map do |p|
                 "- [#{p.name}](##{p.name.downcase.tr(' ', '-')})"
               end, 2))
-%>
  - [Google Authentication](#google-authentication)


## Summary of Supported Products Types / Providers

Below you can find a summary of each supported type and a brief description of
its intended behavior. For full details about each provider, properties,
parameters, usage and examples please visit its respective Chef cookbook project
page.

<% products.each do |product, config| -%>

### <%= product.name -%>

Detailed information can be found at the
[google-<%= product.prefix -%>][] project home page.
The list below is a summary of the supported types by the cookbook:

<% product.objects.reject(&:exclude).each do |object| -%>

- `<%= object.out_name -%>`
<%= wrap_field(object.description, 2) -%>

<% end # objects.each -%>
<% end # products.each -%>

### Google Authentication

This cookbook provides the types to authenticate with Google Cloud Platform.
When executing operations on Google Cloud Platform, e.g. creating a virtual
machine, a SQL database, etc., you need to be authenticated to be able to carry
on with the request.  All Google Cloud Platform cookbooks use an unified
authentication mechanism, provided by this cookbook.

For examples, installation and usage visit the [google-gauth][] cookbook home
page.
