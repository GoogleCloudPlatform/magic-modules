# NOTE: The deleted resource record set is intentionally missing here. Because
# this is an asynchronous operation, and our FakeWeb network capture framework
# can only accomodate looking at the last request, then we miss its passing
# through the wire.
#
# TODO(nelsonjr): Contribute to FakeWeb to enable capturing all traffic of a
# session, so we can inspect properly this request.
