              Namespaces provide isolation for IDs, so an ID only needs to be unique within its namespace.

              Namespaces are currently only created as part of `IdentitySource` creation from Admin Console.
              A namespace `identitysources/{identity_source_id}` is created corresponding to every Identity
              Source identity_source_id.
