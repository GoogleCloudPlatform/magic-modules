      Logs-based metric can also be used to extract values from logs and create a a distribution
      of the values. The distribution records the statistics of the extracted values along with
      an optional histogram of the values as specified by the bucket options.

          A map from a label key string to an extractor expression which is used to extract data from a log

        name: valueExtractor
        description: |
          A valueExtractor is required when using a distribution logs-based metric to extract the values to
          record from a log entry. Two functions are supported for value extraction - EXTRACT(field) or
          REGEXP_EXTRACT(field, regex). The argument are 1. field - The name of the log entry field from which
          the value is to be extracted. 2. regex - A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax
          (https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) with a single capture group to extract data from the specified
          log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an
          error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group.
