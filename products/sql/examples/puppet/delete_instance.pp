# Cloud SQL cannot reuse instance names. Add a random suffix so they are always
# unique. You should set FACTER_sql_instance_suffix, or use any other Puppet
# supported way, to set a global variable $sql_instance_suffix.
#
# For example you can define the fact to be an always increasing value:
#
# $ FACTER_sql_instance_suffix=$(date +%s) puppet apply examples/instance.pp
#
# To be able to delete the instance via Puppet make sure the instance ID matches
# the ID used during creation. If you used the create example and specified the
# 'sql_instance_suffix', you should match it as well during deletion.
