      Represents an Address resource.

      Each virtual machine instance has an ephemeral internal IP address and,
      optionally, an external IP address. To communicate between instances on
      the same network, you can use an instance's internal IP address. To
      communicate with the Internet and instances outside of the same network,
      you must specify the instance's external IP address.

      Internal IP addresses are ephemeral and only belong to an instance for
      the lifetime of the instance; if the instance is deleted and recreated,
      the instance is assigned a new internal IP address, either by Compute
      Engine or by you. External IP addresses can be either ephemeral or
      static.

                  If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that represents the

                  to group resizing.

                  For example, a good metric to use with the target is
                  `pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages`
                  or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to

                  A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median
                  latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a
                  single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target

                  A filter string to be used as the filter string for
                  a Stackdriver Monitoring TimeSeries.list API call.
                  This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for
                  the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric
                  is exporting per-instance or per-group data.

                  You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
                  You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
                  any functions for each selector.
                  You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
                  metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
                  be identical.

                  The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
                  expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
                  expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
                  instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
                  labels.

                  If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
                  this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
                  instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
                  point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
                  This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.

                  If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.

                  You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
                  one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
                  (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
                  TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
                  will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

          affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other properties. This load balancing
          policy is applicable only for HTTP connections. The affinity to a particular
          destination host will be lost when one or more hosts are added/removed from the
          destination service. This field specifies parameters that control consistent
          hashing. This field only applies if the load_balancing_scheme is set to
          INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. This field is only applicable when locality_lb_policy is
          set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH.

          The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
          The possible values are -

          ROUND_ROBIN - This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
                        is selected in round robin order.

          LEAST_REQUEST - An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
                          hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.

          RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
                      hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
                      addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
                      1/N of the requests.

          RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.

          ORIGINAL_DESTINATION - Backend host is selected based on the client
                                 connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
                                 to the same address as the destination address of
                                 the incoming connection before the connection
                                 was redirected to the load balancer.

          MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
                   Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
                   build times and host selection times. For more information about
                   Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824

                The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint
                Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list
                of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine
                instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as
                the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service
                are allowed to use same Instance Group resource.

                For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All
                endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances
                located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group.

                Network Endpoint Group backends.

                Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a

          The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality.
          The possible values are -

          ROUND_ROBIN - This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend
                        is selected in round robin order.

          LEAST_REQUEST - An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy
                          hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.

          RING_HASH - The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent
                      hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
                      addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects
                      1/N of the requests.

          RANDOM - The load balancer selects a random healthy host.

          ORIGINAL_DESTINATION - Backend host is selected based on the client
                                 connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened
                                 to the same address as the destination address of
                                 the incoming connection before the connection
                                 was redirected to the load balancer.

          MAGLEV - used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer.
                   Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup
                   build times and host selection times. For more information about
                   Maglev, refer to https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824

              This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for success rate outlier
              ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the mean success
              rate, and the product of this factor and the standard deviation of the mean
              success rate: mean - (stdev * success_rate_stdev_factor). This factor is divided
              by a thousand to get a double. That is, if the desired factor is 1.9, the
              runtime value should be 1900. Defaults to 1900.

      Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to
      the physical disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the
      hardware behind these devices to ensure data redundancy and optimize
      performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard
      hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).

      Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine
      instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data
      even after you delete your instances. Persistent disk performance scales
      automatically with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks
      or add more persistent disks to an instance to meet your performance and
      storage space requirements.

      Add a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and
      affordable storage with consistent performance characteristics.

          The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.

          Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing
          scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).

          When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding
          rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding
          rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding
          rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same
          scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding
          rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4
          or IPv6.

          When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC
          1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the
          forwarding rule. By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral
          internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP range
          of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.

          An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a URL
          reference to an existing Address resource. The following examples are
          all valid:

      Health Checks determine whether instances are responsive and able to do work.
      They are an important part of a comprehensive load balancing configuration,
      as they enable monitoring instances behind load balancers.

      Health Checks poll instances at a specified interval. Instances that
      do not respond successfully to some number of probes in a row are marked
      as unhealthy. No new connections are sent to unhealthy instances,
      though existing connections will continue. The health check will
      continue to poll unhealthy instances. If an instance later responds
      successfully to some number of consecutive probes, it is marked
      healthy again and can receive new connections.

      Represents an Image resource.

      Google Compute Engine uses operating system images to create the root
      persistent disks for your instances. You specify an image when you create
      an instance. Images contain a boot loader, an operating system, and a
      root file system. Linux operating system images are also capable of
      running containers on Compute Engine.

      Images can be either public or custom.

      Public images are provided and maintained by Google, open-source
      communities, and third-party vendors. By default, all projects have
      access to these images and can use them to create instances.  Custom
      images are available only to your project. You can create a custom image
      from root persistent disks and other images. Then, use the custom image
      to create an instance.

      Network endpoint groups (NEGs) are zonal resources that represent
      collections of IP address and port combinations for GCP resources within a
      single subnet. Each IP address and port combination is called a network
      endpoint.

      Network endpoint groups can be used as backends in backend services for
      HTTP(S), TCP proxy, and SSL proxy load balancers. You cannot use NEGs as a
      backend with internal load balancers. Because NEG backends allow you to
      specify IP addresses and ports, you can distribute traffic in a granular
      fashion among applications or containers running within VM instances.

                  If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that represents the

                  an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled group.
                  The autoscaler will keep the number of instances proportional to the
                  value of this metric, the metric itself should not change value due
                  to group resizing.

                  For example, a good metric to use with the target is
                  `pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages`
                  or a custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to

                  A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median
                  latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a
                  single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target

                  A filter string to be used as the filter string for
                  a Stackdriver Monitoring TimeSeries.list API call.
                  This filter is used to select a specific TimeSeries for
                  the purpose of autoscaling and to determine whether the metric
                  is exporting per-instance or per-group data.

                  You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.
                  You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without
                  any functions for each selector.
                  You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the
                  metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must
                  be identical.

                  The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are
                  expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler
                  expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each
                  instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource
                  labels.

                  If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects
                  this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled
                  instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to
                  point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
                  This is called a per-group metric for the purpose of autoscaling.

                  If not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance.

                  You should provide a filter that is selective enough to pick just
                  one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the instances
                  (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
                  TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
                  will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

      Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to
      the physical disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the
      hardware behind these devices to ensure data redundancy and optimize
      performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard
      hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).

      Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine
      instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data
      even after you delete your instances. Persistent disk performance scales
      automatically with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks
      or add more persistent disks to an instance to meet your performance and
      storage space requirements.

      Add a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and
      affordable storage with consistent performance characteristics.

          After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must
          provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk
          snapshot or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).

          Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
          the disk.

          If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then
          the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and
          you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.

      Health Checks determine whether instances are responsive and able to do work.
      They are an important part of a comprehensive load balancing configuration,
      as they enable monitoring instances behind load balancers.

      Health Checks poll instances at a specified interval. Instances that
      do not respond successfully to some number of probes in a row are marked
      as unhealthy. No new connections are sent to unhealthy instances,
      though existing connections will continue. The health check will
      continue to poll unhealthy instances. If an instance later responds
      successfully to some number of consecutive probes, it is marked
      healthy again and can receive new connections.

                  * `USE_SERVING_PORT`: For NetworkEndpointGroup, the port specified for each
                  network endpoint is used for health checking. For other backends, the
                  port or named port specified in the Backend Service is used for health
                  checking.

      Represents a Route resource.

      A route is a rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by
      the virtual network. Routes are associated with virtual machines by tag,
      and the set of routes for a particular virtual machine is called its
      routing table. For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system
      searches that virtual machine's routing table for a single best matching
      route.

      Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more
      specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects
      the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it
      uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the
      remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by
      the next_hop field of the winning route -- either to another virtual
      machine destination, a virtual machine gateway or a Compute
      Engine-operated gateway. Packets that do not match any route in the
      sending virtual machine's routing table will be dropped.

      A Route resource must have exactly one specification of either
      nextHopGateway, nextHopInstance, nextHopIp, or nextHopVpnTunnel.

      Represents a Persistent Disk Snapshot resource.

      Use snapshots to back up data from your persistent disks. Snapshots are
      different from public images and custom images, which are used primarily
      to create instances or configure instance templates. Snapshots are useful
      for periodic backup of the data on your persistent disks. You can create
      snapshots from persistent disks even while they are attached to running
      instances.

      Snapshots are incremental, so you can create regular snapshots on a
      persistent disk faster and at a much lower cost than if you regularly
      created a full image of the disk.
    # 'createSnapshot' is a zonal operation while 'snapshot.delete' is a global
    # operation. we'll leave the object as global operation and use the disk's
    # zonal operation for the create action.

      A VPC network is a virtual version of the traditional physical networks
      that exist within and between physical data centers. A VPC network
      provides connectivity for your Compute Engine virtual machine (VM)
      instances, Container Engine containers, App Engine Flex services, and
      other network-related resources.

      Each GCP project contains one or more VPC networks. Each VPC network is a
      global entity spanning all GCP regions. This global VPC network allows VM
      instances and other resources to communicate with each other via internal,
      private IP addresses.

      Each VPC network is subdivided into subnets, and each subnet is contained
      within a single region. You can have more than one subnet in a region for
      a given VPC network. Each subnet has a contiguous private RFC1918 IP
      space. You create instances, containers, and the like in these subnets.
      When you create an instance, you must create it in a subnet, and the
      instance draws its internal IP address from that subnet.

      Virtual machine (VM) instances in a VPC network can communicate with
      instances in all other subnets of the same VPC network, regardless of
      region, using their RFC1918 private IP addresses. You can isolate portions
      of the network, even entire subnets, using firewall rules.

          field is properly set to a value between [0, 1].

          backupPool and failoverRatio together define the fallback behavior of
          the primary target pool: if the ratio of the healthy instances in the
          primary pool is at or below failoverRatio, traffic arriving at the
          load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup pool.

          In case where failoverRatio and backupPool are not set, or all the
          instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be
          directed back to the primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic
          will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to
          all instances when no instance is healthy.
