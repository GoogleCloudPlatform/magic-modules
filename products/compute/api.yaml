      Represents an Address resource.

      Each virtual machine instance has an ephemeral internal IP address and,
      optionally, an external IP address. To communicate between instances on
      the same network, you can use an instance's internal IP address. To
      communicate with the Internet and instances outside of the same network,
      you must specify the instance's external IP address.

      Internal IP addresses are ephemeral and only belong to an instance for
      the lifetime of the instance; if the instance is deleted and recreated,
      the instance is assigned a new internal IP address, either by Compute
      Engine or by you. External IP addresses can be either ephemeral or
      static.

      Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to
      the physical disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the
      hardware behind these devices to ensure data redundancy and optimize
      performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard
      hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).

      Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine
      instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data
      even after you delete your instances. Persistent disk performance scales
      automatically with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks
      or add more persistent disks to an instance to meet your performance and
      storage space requirements.

      Add a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and
      affordable storage with consistent performance characteristics.

      Health Checks determine whether instances are responsive and able to do work.
      They are an important part of a comprehensive load balancing configuration,
      as they enable monitoring instances behind load balancers.

      Health Checks poll instances at a specified interval. Instances that
      do not respond successfully to some number of probes in a row are marked
      as unhealthy. No new connections are sent to unhealthy instances,
      though existing connections will continue. The health check will
      continue to poll unhealthy instances. If an instance later responds
      successfully to some number of consecutive probes, it is marked
      healthy again and can receive new connections.

      Represents an Image resource.

      Google Compute Engine uses operating system images to create the root

      an instance. Images contain a boot loader, an operating system, and a
      root file system. Linux operating system images are also capable of
      running containers on Compute Engine.

      Images can be either public or custom.

      Public images are provided and maintained by Google, open-source
      communities, and third-party vendors. By default, all projects have
      access to these images and can use them to create instances.  Custom
      images are available only to your project. You can create a custom image
      from root persistent disks and other images. Then, use the custom image
      to create an instance.

      Represents a Network resource.

      Your Cloud Platform Console project can contain multiple networks, and
      each network can have multiple instances attached to it. A network allows
      you to define a gateway IP and the network range for the instances
      attached to that network. Every project is provided with a default network
      with preset configurations and firewall rules. You can choose to customize
      the default network by adding or removing rules, or you can create new
      networks in that project. Generally, most users only need one network,
      although you can have up to five networks per project by default.

      A network belongs to only one project, and each instance can only belong
      to one network. All Compute Engine networks use the IPv4 protocol. Compute
      Engine currently does not support IPv6. However, Google is a major
      advocate of IPv6 and it is an important future direction.

      Persistent disks are durable storage devices that function similarly to
      the physical disks in a desktop or a server. Compute Engine manages the
      hardware behind these devices to ensure data redundancy and optimize
      performance for you. Persistent disks are available as either standard
      hard disk drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD).

      Persistent disks are located independently from your virtual machine
      instances, so you can detach or move persistent disks to keep your data
      even after you delete your instances. Persistent disk performance scales
      automatically with size, so you can resize your existing persistent disks
      or add more persistent disks to an instance to meet your performance and
      storage space requirements.

      Add a persistent disk to your instance when you need reliable and
      affordable storage with consistent performance characteristics.

      Represents a Route resource.

      A route is a rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by
      the virtual network. Routes are associated with virtual machines by tag,
      and the set of routes for a particular virtual machine is called its
      routing table. For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system
      searches that virtual machine's routing table for a single best matching
      route.

      Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more
      specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects
      the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it
      uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the
      remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by
      the next_hop field of the winning route -- either to another virtual
      machine destination, a virtual machine gateway or a Compute
      Engine-operated gateway. Packets that do not match any route in the
      sending virtual machine's routing table will be dropped.

      A Route resource must have exactly one specification of either
      nextHopGateway, nextHopInstance, nextHopIp, or nextHopVpnTunnel.

      Represents a Persistent Disk Snapshot resource.

      Use snapshots to back up data from your persistent disks. Snapshots are
      different from public images and custom images, which are used primarily
      to create instances or configure instance templates. Snapshots are useful
      for periodic backup of the data on your persistent disks. You can create
      snapshots from persistent disks even while they are attached to running
      instances.

      Snapshots are incremental, so you can create regular snapshots on a
      persistent disk faster and at a much lower cost than if you regularly
      created a full image of the disk.
    # 'createSnapshot' is a zonal operation while 'snapshot.delete' is a global
    # operation. we'll leave the object as global operation and use the disk's

      A VPC network is a virtual version of the traditional physical networks
      that exist within and between physical data centers. A VPC network
      provides connectivity for your Compute Engine virtual machine (VM)
      instances, Container Engine containers, App Engine Flex services, and
      other network-related resources.

      Each GCP project contains one or more VPC networks. Each VPC network is a
      global entity spanning all GCP regions. This global VPC network allows VM
      instances and other resources to communicate with each other via internal,
      private IP addresses.

      Each VPC network is subdivided into subnets, and each subnet is contained
      within a single region. You can have more than one subnet in a region for
      a given VPC network. Each subnet has a contiguous private RFC1918 IP
      space. You create instances, containers, and the like in these subnets.
      When you create an instance, you must create it in a subnet, and the
      instance draws its internal IP address from that subnet.

      Virtual machine (VM) instances in a VPC network can communicate with
      instances in all other subnets of the same VPC network, regardless of
      region, using their RFC1918 private IP addresses. You can isolate portions
      of the network, even entire subnets, using firewall rules.
