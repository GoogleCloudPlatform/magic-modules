# TODO(nelsonjr): Implement updating metadata *after* resource is created.

# Expose instance 'metadata' as a simple name/value pair hash. However the API
# defines metadata as a NestedObject with the following layout:
#
# metadata {
#   fingerprint: 'hash-of-last-metadata'
#   items: [
#     {
#       key: 'metadata1-key'
#       value: 'metadata1-value'
#     },
#     ...
#   ]
# }
#
# Fingerpint is an optimistic locking mechanism for updates, which requires
# adding the 'fingerprint' of the last metadata to allow update.
#
# To comply with the API please add an encoder: and decoder: to the provider.
