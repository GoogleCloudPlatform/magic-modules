    A list of tags to apply to this instance. Tags are used to identify
    valid sources or targets for network firewalls and are specified by
    the client during instance creation. The tags can be later modified
    by the setTags method. Each tag within the list must comply with
    RFC1035.

    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
      name: 'fingerprint'
      description: |
        Specifies a fingerprint for this request, which is essentially a
        hash of the metadata's contents and used for optimistic locking.
        The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and
        changes after every request to modify or update metadata. You
        must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to
        update or change metadata.
    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Array
      name: 'items'
      description: |
        An array of tags. Each tag must be 1-63 characters long, and
        comply with RFC1035.
