    An array of configurations for this interface. This specifies
    how this interface is configured to interact with other
    network services, such as connecting to the internet. Only
    one network interface is supported per instance.

         An array of configurations for this interface. Currently, only
         one access config, ONE_TO_ONE_NAT, is supported. If there are no
         accessConfigs specified, then this instance will have no
         external internet access.

               The name of this access configuration. The
               default and recommended name is External NAT but you can
               use any arbitrary string you would like. For example, My

               An external IP address associated with this instance.
               Specify an unused static external IP address available to
               the project or leave this field undefined to use an IP
               from a shared ephemeral IP address pool. If you specify a

                system or used by other network interfaces. This range
                may be a single IP address (e.g. 10.2.3.4), a netmask
                (e.g. /24) or a CIDR format string (e.g. 10.1.2.0/24).

                CIDR range for this alias IP range. If left

          an instance, if neither the network nor the subnetwork is specified,
          the default network global/networks/default is used; if the network

        description: |
          An IPv4 internal network address to assign to the

          Reference to a gcompute_subnetwork resource.
          If the network resource is in legacy mode, do not
          provide this property.  If the network is in auto
          subnet mode, providing the subnetwork is optional. If
          the network is in custom subnet mode, then this field
          should be specified.
