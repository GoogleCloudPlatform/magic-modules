- !ruby/object:Api::Type::Array
  name: 'disks'
  description: |
    An array of disks that are associated with the instances that are
    created from this template.
<% if type == 'Instance' -%>
  input: true
<% end -%>
  item_type: !ruby/object:Api::Type::NestedObject
    properties:
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
        name: 'autoDelete'
        description: |
          Specifies whether the disk will be auto-deleted when the
          instance is deleted (but not when the disk is detached from
          the instance).

          Tip: Disks should be set to autoDelete=true
          so that leftover disks are not left behind on machine
          deletion.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
        name: 'boot'
        description: |
          Indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machine will
          use the first partition of the disk for its root filesystem.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
        name: 'deviceName'
        description: |
          Specifies a unique device name of your choice that is
          reflected into the /dev/disk/by-id/google-* tree of a Linux
          operating system running within the instance. This name can
          be used to reference the device for mounting, resizing, and
          so on, from within the instance.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::NestedObject
        name: 'diskEncryptionKey'
        description: |
          Encrypts or decrypts a disk using a customer-supplied
          encryption key.
        properties:
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
            name: 'rawKey'
            description: |
              Specifies a 256-bit customer-supplied encryption key,
              encoded in RFC 4648 base64 to either encrypt or decrypt
              this resource.
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
            name: 'rsaEncryptedKey'
            description: |
              Specifies an RFC 4648 base64 encoded, RSA-wrapped
              2048-bit customer-supplied encryption key to either
              encrypt or decrypt this resource.
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
            name: 'sha256'
            description: |
              The RFC 4648 base64 encoded SHA-256 hash of the
              customer-supplied encryption key that protects this
              resource.
            output: true
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
        name: 'index'
        description: |
          Assigns a zero-based index to this disk, where 0 is
          reserved for the boot disk. For example, if you have many
          disks attached to an instance, each disk would have a
          unique index number. If not specified, the server will
          choose an appropriate value.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::NestedObject
        name: 'initializeParams'
        description: |
          Specifies the parameters for a new disk that will be
          created alongside the new instance. Use initialization
          parameters to create boot disks or local SSDs attached to
          the new instance.
        input: true
        properties:
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
            name: 'diskName'
            description: |
              Specifies the disk name. If not specified, the default
              is to use the name of the instance.
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
            name: 'diskSizeGb'
            description: Specifies the size of the disk in base-2 GB.

          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::ResourceRef
            name: 'diskType'
            description: |
              Reference to a disk type.
              Specifies the disk type to use to create the instance.
              If not specified, the default is pd-standard.

            imports: 'selfLink'
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
            name: 'sourceImage'
            description: |
              The source image to create this disk. When creating a
              new instance, one of initializeParams.sourceImage or
              disks.source is required.  To create a disk with one of
              the public operating system images, specify the image
              by its family name.
          - !ruby/object:Api::Type::NestedObject
            name: 'sourceImageEncryptionKey'
            description: |
              The customer-supplied encryption key of the source
              image. Required if the source image is protected by a
              customer-supplied encryption key.

              Instance templates do not store customer-supplied
              encryption keys, so you cannot create disks for
              instances in a managed instance group if the source
              images are encrypted with your own keys.
            properties:

                  key, encoded in RFC 4648 base64 to either encrypt
                  or decrypt this resource.

        name: 'interface'
        description: |
          Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this
          disk, which is either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI.
          Persistent disks must always use SCSI and the request will
          fail if you attempt to attach a persistent disk in any
          other format than SCSI.
        values:
          - :SCSI

          The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE or
