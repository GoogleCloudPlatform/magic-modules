    Name of the resource. The name must be 1-63 characters long and match

    An optional description of this resource.
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::NestedObject
  name: 'autoscalingPolicy'
  description: |
    The configuration parameters for the autoscaling algorithm. You can
    define one or more of the policies for an autoscaler: cpuUtilization,
    customMetricUtilizations, and loadBalancingUtilization.

    If none of these are specified, the default will be to autoscale based
    on cpuUtilization to 0.6 or 60%.
  required: true
  properties:
    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
      name: 'minNumReplicas'
      description: |
        The minimum number of replicas that the autoscaler can scale down
        to. This cannot be less than 0. If not provided, autoscaler will
        choose a default value depending on maximum number of instances
        allowed.
    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
      name: 'maxNumReplicas'
      description: |
        The maximum number of instances that the autoscaler can scale up
        to. This is required when creating or updating an autoscaler. The
        maximum number of replicas should not be lower than minimal number
        of replicas.
      required: true
    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
      name: 'coolDownPeriodSec'
      description: |
        The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it
        starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents
        the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is
        initializing, during which the collected usage would not be
        reliable. The default time autoscaler waits is 60 seconds.

        Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of
        numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an
        instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance
        and time the startup process.
      default_value: 60
    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::NestedObject
      name: 'cpuUtilization'
      description: |
        Defines the CPU utilization policy that allows the autoscaler to
        scale based on the average CPU utilization of a managed instance
        group.
      properties:
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Double
        name: 'utilizationTarget'
        description: |
          The target CPU utilization that the autoscaler should maintain.
          Must be a float value in the range (0, 1]. If not specified, the
          default is 0.6.

          If the CPU level is below the target utilization, the autoscaler
          scales down the number of instances until it reaches the minimum
          number of instances you specified or until the average CPU of
          your instances reaches the target utilization.

          If the average CPU is above the target utilization, the autoscaler
          scales up until it reaches the maximum number of instances you
          specified or until the average utilization reaches the target
          utilization.

          name: 'metric'
          description: |
            The identifier (type) of the Stackdriver Monitoring metric.
            The metric cannot have negative values.

            The metric must have a value type of INT64 or DOUBLE.

        - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Double
          name: 'utilizationTarget'
          description: |
            The target value of the metric that autoscaler should
            maintain. This must be a positive value. A utilization
            metric scales number of virtual machines handling requests
            to increase or decrease proportionally to the metric.

            For example, a good metric to use as a utilizationTarget is
            www.googleapis.com/compute/instance/network/received_bytes_count.
            The autoscaler will work to keep this value constant for each
            of the instances.

          name: 'utilizationTargetType'

            Stackdriver Monitoring metric. Either GAUGE, DELTA_PER_SECOND,
            or DELTA_PER_MINUTE.

        name: 'utilizationTarget'
        description: |
          Fraction of backend capacity utilization (set in HTTP(s) load
          balancing configuration) that autoscaler should maintain. Must
          be a positive float value. If not defined, the default is 0.8.
