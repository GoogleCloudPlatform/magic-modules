        description: |
          The IP address that this forwarding rule is serving on behalf of.

          Addresses are restricted based on the forwarding rule's load balancing
          scheme (EXTERNAL or INTERNAL) and scope (global or regional).

          When the load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, for global forwarding
          rules, the address must be a global IP, and for regional forwarding
          rules, the address must live in the same region as the forwarding
          rule. If this field is empty, an ephemeral IPv4 address from the same
          scope (global or regional) will be assigned. A regional forwarding
          rule supports IPv4 only. A global forwarding rule supports either IPv4
          or IPv6.

          When the load balancing scheme is INTERNAL, this can only be an RFC
          1918 IP address belonging to the network/subnet configured for the
          forwarding rule. By default, if this field is empty, an ephemeral
          internal IP address will be automatically allocated from the IP range
          of the subnet or network configured for this forwarding rule.

          An address can be specified either by a literal IP address or a URL
          reference to an existing Address resource. The following examples are
          all valid:

          * 100.1.2.3
