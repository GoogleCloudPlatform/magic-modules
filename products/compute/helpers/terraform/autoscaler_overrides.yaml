  # Even though this field isn't actually required by the API, it makes our
  # lives easier if we treat it as a required field. It has a default that is
  # set by the API based on the value of maxNumReplicas. Normally in this case
  # we would just set it to Optional+Computed. However, this currently doesn't
  # work with nested fields. Make it required so we don't set the field to zero
  # when our users aren't expecting us to. For more info, see
  # https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules/issues/305.
