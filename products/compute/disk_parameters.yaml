  description: |
    Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.

    After you encrypt a disk with a customer-supplied key, you must
    provide the same key if you use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk
    snapshot or an image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine).

    Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to metadata of
    the disk.

    If you do not provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then
    the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and
    you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.
  properties:
    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
      name: 'rawKey'
      description: |
        Specifies a 256-bit customer-supplied encryption key, encoded in
        RFC 4648 base64 to either encrypt or decrypt this resource.
    - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
      name: 'sha256'
      description: |
        The RFC 4648 base64 encoded SHA-256 hash of the customer-supplied
        encryption key that protects this resource.
      output: true
  input: true
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::ResourceRef
  name: 'sourceSnapshot'
  resource: 'Snapshot'
  imports: 'selfLink'
  description: |
    The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can provide this as
    a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the following are
    valid values:

    * `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot`
    * `projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot`
    * `global/snapshots/snapshot`
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::NestedObject
  name: 'sourceSnapshotEncryptionKey'
  description: |
    The customer-supplied encryption key of the source snapshot. Required
    if the source snapshot is protected by a customer-supplied encryption
    key.

      output: true
  input: true
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
  name: 'sourceSnapshotId'
  description: |
    The unique ID of the snapshot used to create this disk. This value
    identifies the exact snapshot that was used to create this persistent
    disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from a snapshot
    that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
    snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the snapshot that was
    used.
  output: true
