  description: |
    The name of a Google Compute Engine machine type (e.g.
    n1-standard-1).  If unspecified, the default machine type is
    n1-standard-1.
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
  name: 'diskSizeGb'
  description: |
    Size of the disk attached to each node, specified in GB. The
    smallest allowed disk size is 10GB. If unspecified, the default
    disk size is 100GB.
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::Array
  name: 'oauthScopes'
  item_type: Api::Type::String
  description: |
    The set of Google API scopes to be made available on all of the
    node VMs under the "default" service account.

    The following scopes are recommended, but not required, and by
    default are not included:

    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute is required for mounting
    persistent storage on your nodes.
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only is required
    for communicating with gcr.io (the Google Container Registry).

    If unspecified, no scopes are added, unless Cloud Logging or Cloud
    Monitoring are enabled, in which case their required scopes will
    be added.
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
  name: 'serviceAccount'
  description: |
    The Google Cloud Platform Service Account to be used by the node
    VMs.  If no Service Account is specified, the "default" service
    account is used.
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::NameValues
  name: 'metadata'
  key_type: Api::Type::String
  value_type: Api::Type::String
  description: |
    The metadata key/value pairs assigned to instances in the cluster.

    Keys must conform to the regexp [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+ and be less than
    128 bytes in length. These are reflected as part of a URL in the
    metadata server. Additionally, to avoid ambiguity, keys must not
    conflict with any other metadata keys for the project or be one of
    the four reserved keys: "instance-template", "kube-env",
    "startup-script", and "user-data"

    Values are free-form strings, and only have meaning as interpreted
    by the image running in the instance. The only restriction placed
    on them is that each value's size must be less than or equal to 32
    KB.

    The total size of all keys and values must be less than 512 KB.

    An object containing a list of "key": value pairs.
    Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
  name: 'imageType'
  description: |
    The image type to use for this node.  Note that for a given image
    type, the latest version of it will be used.
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::NameValues
  name: 'labels'
  key_type: Api::Type::String
  value_type: Api::Type::String
  description: |
    The map of Kubernetes labels (key/value pairs) to be applied to
    each node. These will added in addition to any default label(s)
    that Kubernetes may apply to the node. In case of conflict in
    label keys, the applied set may differ depending on the Kubernetes
    version -- it's best to assume the behavior is undefined and
    conflicts should be avoided. For more information, including usage
    and the valid values, see:
      http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/docs/user-guide/labels.html

    An object containing a list of "key": value pairs.
    Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::Integer
  name: 'localSsdCount'
  description: |
    The number of local SSD disks to be attached to the node.

    The limit for this value is dependant upon the maximum number of
    disks available on a machine per zone. See:

    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#local_ssd_limits

    for more information.
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::Array
  name: 'tags'
  item_type: Api::Type::String
  description: |
    The list of instance tags applied to all nodes. Tags are used to
    identify valid sources or targets for network firewalls and are
    specified by the client during cluster or node pool creation. Each
    tag within the list must comply with RFC1035.
- !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
  name: 'preemptible'
  description: |
    Whether the nodes are created as preemptible VM instances. See:
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible for
    more inforamtion about preemptible VM instances.
