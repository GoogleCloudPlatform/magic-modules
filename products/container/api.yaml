              https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute is required for mounting

              https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only is required

              Keys must conform to the regexp [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+ and be less than
              128 bytes in length. These are reflected as part of a URL in the
              metadata server. Additionally, to avoid ambiguity, keys must not
              conflict with any other metadata keys for the project or be one of
              the four reserved keys: "instance-template", "kube-env",
              "startup-script", and "user-data"

              Values are free-form strings, and only have meaning as interpreted
              by the image running in the instance. The only restriction placed
              on them is that each value's size must be less than or equal to 32
              KB.

              The total size of all keys and values must be less than 512 KB.

      NodePool contains the name and configuration for a cluster's node pool.
      Node pools are a set of nodes (i.e. VM's), with a common configuration and
      specification, under the control of the cluster master. They may have a
      set of Kubernetes labels applied to them, which may be used to reference
      them during pod scheduling. They may also be resized up or down, to
      accommodate the workload.

              The set of Google API scopes to be made available on all of the
              node VMs under the "default" service account.

              The following scopes are recommended, but not required, and by
              default are not included:

              https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute is required for mounting
              persistent storage on your nodes.
              https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only is required
              for communicating with gcr.io (the Google Container Registry).

              If unspecified, no scopes are added, unless Cloud Logging or Cloud
              Monitoring are enabled, in which case their required scopes will
              be added.

            name: 'metadata'
            description: |
              The metadata key/value pairs assigned to instances in the cluster.

              Keys must conform to the regexp [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+ and be less than
              128 bytes in length. These are reflected as part of a URL in the
              metadata server. Additionally, to avoid ambiguity, keys must not
              conflict with any other metadata keys for the project or be one of
              the four reserved keys: "instance-template", "kube-env",
              "startup-script", and "user-data"

              Values are free-form strings, and only have meaning as interpreted
              by the image running in the instance. The only restriction placed
              on them is that each value's size must be less than or equal to 32
              KB.

              The total size of all keys and values must be less than 512 KB.

            name: 'labels'
            description: |
              The map of Kubernetes labels (key/value pairs) to be applied to
              each node. These will added in addition to any default label(s)
              that Kubernetes may apply to the node. In case of conflict in
              label keys, the applied set may differ depending on the Kubernetes
              version -- it's best to assume the behavior is undefined and
              conflicts should be avoided. For more information, including usage
              and the valid values, see:
