              https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute is required for mounting

              https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only is required

              Keys must conform to the regexp [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+ and be less than
              128 bytes in length. These are reflected as part of a URL in the
              metadata server. Additionally, to avoid ambiguity, keys must not
              conflict with any other metadata keys for the project or be one of
              the four reserved keys: "instance-template", "kube-env",
              "startup-script", and "user-data"

              Values are free-form strings, and only have meaning as interpreted
              by the image running in the instance. The only restriction placed
              on them is that each value's size must be less than or equal to 32
              KB.

              The total size of all keys and values must be less than 512 KB.
