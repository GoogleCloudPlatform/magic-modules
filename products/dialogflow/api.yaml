      A Dialogflow agent is a virtual agent that handles conversations with your end-users. It is a natural language
      understanding module that understands the nuances of human language. Dialogflow translates end-user text or audio
      during a conversation to structured data that your apps and services can understand. You design and build a Dialogflow
      agent to handle the types of conversations required for your system.

         The default language of the agent as a language tag. [See Language Support](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/reference/language) 
         for a list of the currently supported language codes. This field cannot be updated after creation.

        name: 'avatarUri'
        description: |
         The URI of the agent's avatar, which are used throughout the Dialogflow console. When an image URL is entered
         into this field, the Dialogflow will save the image in the backend. The address of the backend image returned
         from the API will be shown in the [avatarUriBackend] field.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::String
        name: 'avatarUriBackend'
        description: |
         The URI of the agent's avatar as returned from the API. Output only. To provide an image URL for the agent avatar,
         the [avatarUri] field can be used.
        output: true
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Boolean
        name: 'enableLogging'
        description: |
         Determines whether this agent should log conversation queries.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Enum
        name: 'matchMode'
        description: |
          Determines how intents are detected from user queries.
          * MATCH_MODE_HYBRID: Best for agents with a small number of examples in intents and/or wide use of templates
          syntax and composite entities.
          * MATCH_MODE_ML_ONLY: Can be used for agents with a large number of examples in intents, especially the ones
          using @sys.any or very large developer entities.
        values:
          - :MATCH_MODE_HYBRID
          - :MATCH_MODE_ML_ONLY
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Double
        name: 'classificationThreshold'
        description: |
         To filter out false positive results and still get variety in matched natural language inputs for your agent,
         you can tune the machine learning classification threshold. If the returned score value is less than the threshold
         value, then a fallback intent will be triggered or, if there are no fallback intents defined, no intent will be 
         triggered. The score values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). If set to 0.0, the 
         default of 0.3 is used.
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Enum
        name: 'apiVersion'
        description: |
          API version displayed in Dialogflow console. If not specified, V2 API is assumed. Clients are free to query
          different service endpoints for different API versions. However, bots connectors and webhook calls will follow 
          the specified API version.
          * API_VERSION_V1: Legacy V1 API.
          * API_VERSION_V2: V2 API.
          * API_VERSION_V2_BETA_1: V2beta1 API.
        values:
          - :API_VERSION_V1
          - :API_VERSION_V2
          - :API_VERSION_V2_BETA_1
      - !ruby/object:Api::Type::Enum
        name: 'tier'
        description: |
          The agent tier. If not specified, TIER_STANDARD is assumed.
          * TIER_STANDARD: Standard tier.
          * TIER_ENTERPRISE: Enterprise tier (Essentials).
          * TIER_ENTERPRISE_PLUS: Enterprise tier (Plus).
          NOTE: Due to consistency issues, the provider will not read this field from the API. Drift is possible between 
          the Terraform state and Dialogflow if the agent tier is changed outside of Terraform.
        values:
          - :TIER_STANDARD
          - :TIER_ENTERPRISE
          - :TIER_ENTERPRISE_PLUS
