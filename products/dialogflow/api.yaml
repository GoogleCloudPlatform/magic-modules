      A Dialogflow agent is a virtual agent that handles conversations with your end-users. It is a natural language
      understanding module that understands the nuances of human language. Dialogflow translates end-user text or audio
      during a conversation to structured data that your apps and services can understand. You design and build a Dialogflow
      agent to handle the types of conversations required for your system.

          Determines how intents are detected from user queries.
          * MATCH_MODE_HYBRID: Best for agents with a small number of examples in intents and/or wide use of templates
          syntax and composite entities.
          * MATCH_MODE_ML_ONLY: Can be used for agents with a large number of examples in intents, especially the ones
          using @sys.any or very large developer entities.

        description: |
         To filter out false positive results and still get variety in matched natural language inputs for your agent,
         you can tune the machine learning classification threshold. If the returned score value is less than the threshold
         value, then a fallback intent will be triggered or, if there are no fallback intents defined, no intent will be 
         triggered. The score values range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). If set to 0.0, the 
         default of 0.3 is used.
