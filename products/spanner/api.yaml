          Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for organizing
          cloud resources into groups that reflect a customer's organizational
          needs and deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter
          collections of resources. They can be used to control how resource
          metrics are aggregated. And they can be used as arguments to policy
          management rules (e.g. route, firewall, load balancing, etc.).

          Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform
          to the following regular expression: `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`.
          Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform
          to the regular expression `([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)?`.

          No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource.

          See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of
          labels.

          If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that
          additional characters may be allowed in the future. And so you are
          advised to use an internal label representation, such as JSON, which
          doesn't rely upon specific characters being disallowed. For example,
          representing labels as the string: name + "_" + value would prove
          problematic if we were to allow "_" in a future release.

          An object containing a list of "key": value pairs.
          Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }.
