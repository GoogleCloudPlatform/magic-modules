                       The groupByFields determine how
                       the time series are partitioned
                       into subsets prior to applying the
                       aggregation function. Each subset

                       same value for each of the
                       grouping fields. Each individual

                       is applied to each subset of time
                       series. It is not possible to

                       aggregated into a single output
                       time series. If crossSeriesReducer
