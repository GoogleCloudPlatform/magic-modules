          Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store
          creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API will enforce referential integrity and fail the
          requests that will result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API
          will skip referential integrity check. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as
          Patient.get$everything, will not return all the results if broken references exist.

          versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but
          cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions will be kept. The server will send back errors for
          attempts to read the historical versions.
