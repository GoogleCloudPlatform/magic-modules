        description: |
          Note kind that represents a logical attestation "role" or "authority".
          For example, an organization might have one AttestationAuthority for
          "QA" and one for "build". This Note is intended to act strictly as a
          grouping mechanism for the attached Occurrences (Attestations). This
          grouping mechanism also provides a security boundary, since IAM ACLs
          gate the ability for a principle to attach an Occurrence to a given
          Note. It also provides a single point of lookup to find all attached
          Attestation Occurrences, even if they don't all live in the same
          project.

            description: |
              This submessage provides human-readable hints about the purpose of
              the AttestationAuthority. Because the name of a Note acts as its
              resource reference, it is important to disambiguate the canonical
              name of the Note (which might be a UUID for security purposes)
              from "readable" names more suitable for debug output. Note that
              these hints should NOT be used to look up AttestationAuthorities
              in security sensitive contexts, such as when looking up
              Attestations to verify.
