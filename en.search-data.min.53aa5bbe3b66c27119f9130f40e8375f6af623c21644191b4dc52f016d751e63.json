Unit tests do not interact with GCP APIs. Acceptance tests (aka VCR tests, or create and update tests): test that resources interact as expected with the APIs. Acceptance tests interact with GCP APIs, but should only test the provider\u0026rsquo;s behavior in constructing the API requests and parsing the responses. Acceptance tests are also called \u0026ldquo;VCR tests\u0026rdquo; because they use go-vcr to record and play back HTTP requests. This allows tests to run more quickly on PRs because the resources don\u0026rsquo;t actually need to be created, updated, or destroyed by the live API.\nFor more information about testing, see the official Terraform documentation.\nBefore you begin # Determine whether your resources is using MMv1 generation or handwritten.

(You may need to create this file if it does not already exist. Replace PRODUCT with the product name and RESOURCE with the resource name; it should match the name of the generated resource file.)\nUnit tests should be named like TestFunctionName - for example, TestDiskImageDiffSuppress would contain tests for the DiskImageDiffSuppress function.\nExample:\nfunc TestSignatureAlgorithmDiffSuppress(t *testing.T) { cases := map[string]struct { Old, New string ExpectDiffSuppress bool }{ \u0026#34;ECDSA_P256 equivalent\u0026#34;: { Old: \u0026#34;ECDSA_P256_SHA256\u0026#34;, New: \u0026#34;EC_SIGN_P256_SHA256\u0026#34;, ExpectDiffSuppress: true, }, // Additional cases excluded for brevity } for tn, tc := range cases { if signatureAlgorithmDiffSuppress(\u0026#34;signature_algorithm\u0026#34;, tc.Old, tc.New, nil) != tc.ExpectDiffSuppress { t.Errorf(\u0026#34;bad: %s, %q =\u0026gt; %q expect DiffSuppress to return %t\u0026#34;, tn, tc.Old, tc.New, tc.ExpectDiffSuppress) } } } Skip tests in VCR replaying mode # Acceptance tests are run in VCR replaying mode on PRs (using pre-recorded HTTP requests and responses) to reduce the time it takes to present results to contributors. However, not all resources or tests are possible to run in replaying mode. Incompatible tests should be skipped during VCR replaying mode. They will still run in our nightly test suite.\nSkip a generated test Skipping acceptance tests that are generated from example files can be achieved by adding skip_vcr: true in the example\u0026rsquo;s YAML:\nexamples: - name: \u0026#39;bigtable_app_profile_anycluster\u0026#39; ... # bigtable instance does not use the shared HTTP client, this test creates an instance skip_vcr: true If you skip a test in VCR mode, include a code comment explaining the reason for skipping (for example, a link to a GitHub issue.)\nSkip a handwritten test Skipping acceptance tests that are handwritten can be achieved by adding acctest.SkipIfVcr(t) at the start of the test:\nfunc TestAccPubsubTopic_update(t *testing.T) { acctest.SkipIfVcr(t) // See: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues/9999 acctest.VcrTest(t, resource.TestCase{ ... } } If you skip a test in VCR mode, include a code comment explaining the reason for skipping (for example, a link to a GitHub issue.)\nReasons that tests are skipped in VCR replaying mode # Problem How to fix/Other info Skip in VCR replaying? Incorrect or insufficient data is present in VCR recordings to replay tests. Tests will fail with Requested interaction not found errors during REPLAYING mode Make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re not introducing randomness into the test, e.g. by unnecessarily using the random provider to set a resource\u0026rsquo;s name. If you cannot avoid this issue you should skip the test, but try to ensure that it cannot be fixed first. Bigtable acceptance tests aren\u0026rsquo;t working in VCR mode. Requested interaction not found errors are seen during Bigtable tests run in REPLAYING mode Currently the provider uses a separate client than the rest of the provider to interact with the Bigtable API. As HTTP traffic to the Bigtable API doesn\u0026rsquo;t go via the shared client it cannot be recorded in RECORDING mode. Skip the test in VCR for Bigtable. Using multiple provider aliases doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in VCR. You may have two instances of the google provider in the test config but one of them doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be using its provider arguments - for example, using the wrong default project. See this GitHub issue: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues/20019 . The problem is that, due to how the VCR system works, one provider instance will be configured and the other will be forced to reuse the first instance\u0026rsquo;s configuration, despite them being given different provider arguments. Skip the test in VCR is using aliases is unavoidable. Using multiple versions of the google/google-beta provider in a single test isn\u0026rsquo;t working in VCR. Unexpected test failures may occur during tests in REPLAYING mode where ExternalProviders is used to pull in past versions of the google/google-beta provider. When ExternalProviders is used to pulling in other versions of the provider, any HTTP traffic through the external provider will not be recorded. If the HTTP traffic produces an unexpected result or returns an API error then the test will fail in REPLAYING mode. Skip the test in VCR when testing the current provider behaviour versus previous released versions. Some additional things to bear in mind are that VCR tests in REPLAYING mode will still interact with GCP APIs somewhat. For example:\nWhen the provider is configured it will use credentials to obtain access tokens from GCP Some acceptance tests use bootstrapping functions that ensure long-lived resources are present in a testing project before the provider is tested. These tests can still run in VCR replaying mode; however, REPLAYING mode can\u0026rsquo;t be used as a way to completely avoid HTTP traffic generally or with GCP APIs.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? # Run your tests\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/magic-modules/code-review/create-pr/","title":"Create a pull request","section":"Code review","content":" Create a pull request (PR) # Requirements # Make sure your branch contains a single self-contained change. For example: If you are adding multiple resources to the provider, only put one resource in each PR - even if the product requires all resources to be present before it can be meaningfully used. If you are adding a few fields and also fixing a bug, create one PR for adding the new fields and a separate PR for the bugs. Follow the instructions at Creating a pull request to create a pull request to merge your branch into GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules. Make sure the PR body includes the text Fixes GITHUB_ISSUE_LINK. once per issue resolved by your PR. Replace GITHUB_ISSUE_LINK with a link to a GitHub issue from the provider issue tracker. Write release notes Code review # A reviewer will automatically be assigned to your PR. Creating a new pull request or pushing a new commit automatically triggers our CI pipelines and workflows. After CI starts, downstream diff generation takes about 10 minutes; VCR tests can take up to 2 hours. If you are a community contributor, some tests will only run after approval from a reviewer. While convenient, relying on CI to test iterative changes to PRs often adds extreme latency to reviews if there are errors in test configurations or at runtime. We strongly recommend you test your changes locally before pushing even after the initial change. VCR tests will first attempt to play back recorded HTTP requests (REPLAYING mode). If any tests fail, they will run in RECORDING mode to generate a new cassette; then, the same tests will run again in REPLAYING mode to detect any nondeterministic behavior in the test (which can cause flaky tests.) If your assigned reviewer does not respond to changes on a pull request within two US business days, ping them on the pull request. TIP: Speeding up review:\nTest your changes locally before pushing to iterate faster. You can push them and test in parallel as well. New CI runs will preempt old ones where possible. Resolve failed status checks quickly Directly ask your reviewer for help if you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to proceed. If there are failed checks they may only check in if there\u0026rsquo;s no progress after a couple days. Self-review your PR or ask someone else familiar with Terraform to review Troubleshoot status check failures # Provider unit tests or VCR tests # VCR test failures that do not immediately seem related to your PR are most likely safe to ignore unless your reviewer says otherwise.\nReview the \u0026ldquo;diff generation\u0026rdquo; report to make sure the generated code looks as expected. Check out the generated code for your PR to run tests and iterate locally.

Generally, this guidance should be followed and exceptions should be clearly demarcated / discussed. ForceNew in a Terraform resource schema attribute that indicates that a field is immutable – that is, that a change to the field requires the resource to be destroyed and recreated.\nThis is necessary and required for cases where a field can\u0026rsquo;t be updated in-place, so that Terraform\u0026rsquo;s core workflow of aligning real infrastructure with configuration can be achieved. If a field or resource can never be updated in-place and is not marked with ForceNew, that is considered a bug in the provider.\nSome fields or resources may be possible to update in place, but only under specific conditions. In these cases, you can treat the field as updatable - that is, do not mark it as ForceNew; instead, implement standard update functionality. Then, call diff.ForceNew inside a CustomizeDiff if the appropriate conditions to allow update in place are not met. Any CustomizeDiff function like this must be thoroughly unit tested. Making a field conditionally updatable like this is considered a good and useful enhancement in cases where recreation is costly and conditional updates do not introduce undue complexity.\nIn complex cases, it is better to mark the field ForceNew to ensure that users can apply their configurations successfully.\nSafeguarding against deletion # See Deletion behaviors for some mitigations against accidental deletion or other means to safeguard against deletion.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/magic-modules/reference/resource/","title":"MMv1 resource reference","section":"Reference","content":" MMv1 resource reference # This page documents commonly-used properties for resources.

This is only possible when the completed operation\u0026rsquo;s JSON includes the created resource in the \u0026ldquo;response\u0026rdquo; field. If false, the provider sets the resource\u0026rsquo;s Terraform ID before the resource is created, based only on the resource configuration. Default: false. Example:\nasync: actions: [\u0026#39;create\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;update\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;delete\u0026#39;] operation: base_url: \u0026#39;{{op_id}}\u0026#39; result: resource_inside_response: true error_retry_predicates # An array of function names that determine whether an error is retryable.\nerror_retry_predicates: - \u0026#39;transport_tpg.IamMemberMissing\u0026#39; error_abort_predicates # An array of function names that determine whether an error is not retryable.\nerror_abort_predicates: - \u0026#39;transport_tpg.Is429QuotaError\u0026#39; IAM resources # iam_policy # Allows configuration of generated IAM resources.

Usually :. fetch_iam_policy_verb: HTTP method for getIamPolicy. Usually 'POST'. Allowed values: 'GET', 'POST'. Default: 'GET' set_iam_policy_verb: HTTP method for getIamPolicy. Usually 'POST'. Allowed values: 'POST', 'PUT'. Default: 'POST' import_format: Must match the parent resource\u0026rsquo;s import_format (or self_link if import_format is unset), but with the parent_resource_attribute value substituted for the final field. allowed_iam_role: Valid IAM role that can be set by generated tests. Default: 'roles/viewer' iam_conditions_request_type: If IAM conditions are supported, set this attribute to indicate how the conditions should be passed to the API. Allowed values: 'QUERY_PARAM', 'REQUEST_BODY', 'QUERY_PARAM_NESTED'. Note: 'QUERY_PARAM_NESTED' should only be used if the query param field contains a . min_version: beta: Marks IAM support as beta-only.

By convention, these should be fields that do not get sent to the API, and are instead used to modify the behavior of a Terraform resource such as deletion_protection.\nparameters # Contains a list of fields. By convention, these should be the fields that are part URL parameters such as location and name.\nproperties # Contains a list of fields. By convention, these should be fields that aren\u0026rsquo;t part of the URL parameters.\nExample:\nproperties: - name: \u0026#39;fieldOne\u0026#39; type: String Examples # examples # A list of configurations that are used to generate documentation and tests. Each example supports the following common attributes – for a full reference, see examples.go ↗:\nname: snake_case name of the example. This corresponds to the configuration file in mmv1/templates/terraform/examples (excluding the .go.tmpl suffix) and is used to generate the test name and the documentation header. primary_resource_id: The id of the resource under test. This is used by tests to automatically run additional checks. Configuration files should reference this to avoid getting out of sync. For example: resource \u0026quot;google_compute_address\u0026quot; \u0026quot;\u0026quot;{{$.PrimaryResourceId}}\u0026quot; { bootstrap_iam: specify member/role pairs that should always exist. {project_number} will be replaced with the default project\u0026rsquo;s project number. This avoids race conditions when modifying the IAM permissions for the default test project. Permissions attached to resources created in a test should instead be provisioned with standard terraform resources. vars: Key/value pairs of variables to inject into the configuration file. These can be referenced in the configuration file with {{index $.Vars \u0026quot;key\u0026quot;}}. All resource IDs (even for resources not under test) should be declared with variables that contain a - or _; this will ensure that, in tests, the resources are created with a tf-test prefix to allow automatic cleanup of dangling resources and a random suffix to avoid name collisions. test_env_vars: Key/value pairs of variable names and special values indicating variables that should be pulled from the environment during tests. These will receive a neutral default value in documentation. Common special values include: PROJECT_NAME, REGION, ORG_ID, BILLING_ACCT, SERVICE_ACCT (the test runner service account). test_vars_overrides: Key/value pairs of literal overrides for variables used in tests. This can be used to call functions to generate or determine a variable\u0026rsquo;s value. min_version: Set this to beta if the resource is in the google provider but the example will only work with the google-beta provider (for example, because it includes a beta-only field.) ignore_read_extra: Properties to not check on import. This should be used in cases where a property will not be set on import, for example write-only fields. exclude_test: If set to true, no test will be generated based on this example. exclude_docs: If set to true, no documentation will be generated based on this example. exclude_import_test: If set to true, no import test will be generated for this example. skip_vcr: See Skip tests in VCR replaying mode for more information about this flag. skip_test: If not empty, the test generated based on this example will always be skipped. In most cases, the value should be a link to a ticket explaining the issue that needs to be resolved before the test can be unskipped. external_providers: A list of external providers that are needed for the testcase. This does add some latency to the testcase, so only use if necessary. Common external providers: random, time.

This document lists many types of breaking changes but may not be entirely comprehensive. Some types of changes that would normally be \u0026ldquo;breaking\u0026rdquo; may have specific mitigating circumstances that make them non-breaking.\nFor more information, see Make a breaking change.\nProvider-level breaking changes # Changing fundamental provider behavior such as: authentication environment variable usage restricting retry behavior Resource-level breaking changes # Removing or renaming a resource or datasource Changing resource ID format Terraform uses resource ID to read resource state from the API. Modification of the ID format will break the ability to parse the IDs from any deployments. Removing or altering resource import ID formats Automation written by end users may rely on specific import formats. Changes to default resource behavior Changing resource deletion behavior In limited cases changes may be permissible if the prior behavior could never succeed. Changing resource deletion to skip deleting the resource by default if delete was previously called Changing resource deletion to specify a force flag Adding a new field with a default different from the API default If an API default is expected to change- a breaking change for the API- use default_from_api which will avoid sending a value and safely take the server default in Terraform Field-level breaking changes # Removing or renaming a field Changing field output type Between primitive types, like changing a String to an Integer Between complex types like changing a List to a Set. Changing the field type between primitive and complex data types is not possible. For this scenario, field renames are preferred. Making an optional field required or adding a new required field Making a settable field read-only For MMv1 resources, adding output: true to an existing field. For handwritten resources, adding Computed: true to a field that does not have Optional: true set. Even if there is no valid scenario where a field can be set, changing it to read-only may be a breaking change for modules that depend on the provider. Removing support for API-side defaults For MMv1 resources, removing default_from_api: true. For handwritten resources, altering a field schema with Computed: true + Optional: true to only have Optional: true. Adding or changing a default value Default values in Terraform are used to replace null values in configuration at plan/apply time and do not respect previously-configured values by the user. Even in major releases, these changes are often undesirable, as their impact is extremely broad.\nWhen a default is changed, every user that has not specified an explicit value in their configuration will see Terraform propose changing the value of the field including if the change will destroy and recreate the resource due to changing an immutable value. Default changes in the provider are comparable in impact to default changes in an API, and modifying examples and modules may achieve the intended effect with a smaller blast radius.\nModifying how field data is stored in state For example, changing the case of a value returned by the API in a flattener or decorder Removing diff suppression from a field. For MMv1 resources, removing diff_suppress_func from a field. For handwritten resources, removing DiffSuppressFunc from a field. Removing update support from a field. Making validation more strict # Increasing the minimum number of items in an array For MMv1 resources, increasing min_size on an Array field. For handwritten resources, increasing MinItems on an Array field. Decreasing the maximum number of items in an array For MMv1 resources, decreasing max_size on an Array field.

Generally, this guidance should be followed and exceptions should be clearly demarcated / discussed. Mitigating data loss risk via deletion_protection # Some resources, such as databases, have a significant risk of unrecoverable data loss if the resource is accidentally deleted due to a change to a ForceNew field. For these resources, the best practice is to add a deletion_protection field that prevents the resource from being deleted if enabled.\ndeletion_protection fields generally need to be added with a default of false that can be changed to true in the next major release, because adding deletion protection is a major behavioral change. Exceptions to this are:\nThe API has a deletion protection field that defaults to enabled on the API side The deletion_protection field is being added at the same time as the resource If the API has a deletion protection field, the corresponding Terraform field name should match the API field\u0026rsquo;s name and type. For example, if the API has an enum field called what_to_do_on_delete with values DELETE and PROTECT, the Terraform field should do the same.\nA resource can have up to two deletion_protection fields (with different names): one that represents a field in the API, and one that is only in Terraform. This could happen because the API added its field after deletion_protection already existed in Terraform; it could also happen because a separate field was added in Terraform to make sure that deletion_protection is enabled by default. In either case, they should be reconciled into a single field (that defaults to enabled and whose name matches the API field) in the next major release.\nResources that do not have a significant risk of unrecoverable data loss or similar critical concern will not be given deletion_protection fields.\nSee Client-side fields for information about adding deletion_protection fields.\nNote: The previous best practice was a field called force_delete that defaulted to false. This is still present on some resources for backwards-compatibility reasons, but deletion_protection is preferred going forward. Deletion policy # Some resources need to let users control the actions taken add deletion time. For these resources, the best practice is to add a deletion_policy enum field that defaults to an empty string and allows special values that control the deletion behavior.\nOne common example is ABANDON, which is useful if the resource is safe to delete from Terraform but could cause problems if deleted from the API - for example, google_bigtable_gc_policy deletion can fail in replicated instances. ABANDON indicates that attempts to delete the resource should remove it from state without actually deleting it.\nSee Client-side fields for information about adding deletion_policy fields.\nExclude deletion # Some resources do not support deletion in the API and can only be removed from state.

Even as part of a major release, breaking changes that are overly broad and/or have little benefit to users can cause deeply negative reactions and significantly delay customers upgrading to the new major version.\nBreaking changes may cause significant churn for users by forcing them to update their configurations. It also causes churn in tooling built on top of the providers, such as:\nTerraform modules that use google or google-beta resources Policy tools like gcloud terraform vet There may also be churn in customer policies Config Connector Pulumi GCP Classic This page covers the general process to make a breaking change. It does not include exact, comprehensive details on how to make every potential breaking change. Breaking changes are complicated; the exact process and implementation may vary drastically depending on the implementation of the impacted resource or field and the change being made.\nIn minor releases # If a breaking change fixes a bug that impacts all configurations that include a field or resource, it is generally allowed in a minor release. For example:\nRemoving update support from a field if that field is not actually updatable in the API. Marking a field required if omitting the field always causes an API error. The following types of changes can be made if the default behavior stays the same and new behavior can be enabled with a flag:\nMajor resource-level or field-level behavioural changes In the 6.0.0 major release # The general process for contributing a breaking change to the 6.0.0 major release is:\nMake the main branch forwards-compatible with the major release Add deprecations and warnings to the main branch of magic-modules Add upgrade guide entries to the FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 branch of magic-modules Make the breaking change on FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 These are covered in more detail in the following sections. The upgrade guide and the actual breaking change will be merged only after both are completed.\nMake the main branch forwards-compatible with the major release # What forwards-compatibility means will vary depending on the breaking change. For example:\nIf a required field is being removed, make the field optional on the main branch. If a field is being renamed, the new field must be added to the main branch Add deprecations and warnings to the main branch of magic-modules # Deprecations and warnings must be actionable at the time that they are added to the main branch, and they must be added prior to the 6.0.0 major release. Every deprecation or warning should be surfaced to users of the provider at runtime as well as in documentation.\nField deprecation (due to removal or rename) # MMv1 Set deprecation_message on the field. For example:\n- name: \u0026#39;apiFieldName\u0026#39; type: String description: | MULTILINE_FIELD_DESCRIPTION deprecation_message: \u0026#39;`api_field_name` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use `other_field_name` instead.\u0026#39; Replace the second sentence with an appropriate short description of the replacement path and/or the reason for deprecation.\nThe deprecation message will automatically show up in the resource documentation.\nHandwritten Set Deprecated on the field. For example:\n\u0026#34;api_field_name\u0026#34;: { Type: schema.String, Deprecated: \u0026#34;`api_field_name` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use `other_field_name` instead.\u0026#34;, ... } Replace the second sentence with an appropriate short description of the replacement path and/or the reason for deprecation.\nUpdate the documentation for the field to include the deprecation notice. For example:\n* `api_field_name` - (Optional, [Beta](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html), Deprecated) FIELD_DESCRIPTION. `api_field_name` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use `other_field_name` instead. Resource deprecation (due to removal or rename) # MMv1 Set deprecation_message on the resource. For example:\ndeprecation_message: \u0026gt;- `google_RESOURCE_NAME` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use `google_OTHER_RESOURCE_NAME` instead. Replace RESOURCE_NAME with the name of the resource (excluding the google_ prefix). Replace the second sentence with an appropriate short description of the replacement path and/or the reason for deprecation.\nThe deprecation message will automatically show up in the resource documentation.\nHandwritten Set DeprecationMessage on the field. For example:\nreturn \u0026amp;schema.Resource{ ... DeprecationMessage: \u0026#34;`google_RESOURCE_NAME` is deprecated and will be removed in a future \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;major release. Use `google_OTHER_RESOURCE_NAME` instead.\u0026#34;, ... } Replace RESOURCE_NAME with the name of the resource (excluding the google_ prefix). Replace the second sentence with an appropriate short description of the replacement path and/or the reason for deprecation.\nAdd a warning to the resource documentation stating that the resource is deprecated. For example:\n~\u0026gt; **Warning:** `google_RESOURCE_NAME` is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Use `google_OTHER_RESOURCE_NAME` instead. Other breaking changes # Other breaking changes should be called out in the docs for the impacted field or resource. It is also great to log warnings at runtime if possible.\nMake the change on FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 # When working on your breaking change, make sure that your base branch is FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0. This means that you will follow the standard contribution process with the following changes:\nBefore you start, check out and sync your local magic-modules and provider repositories with the upstream major release branches. cd ~/magic-modules git checkout FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 git pull --ff-only origin FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google git checkout FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 git pull --ff-only origin FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta git checkout FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 git pull --ff-only origin FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 Make sure that any deprecation notices and warnings that you added in previous sections are present on the major release branch. Changes to the main branch will be merged into the major release branch every Monday. Make the breaking change. Add the upgrade guide entries to version_6_upgrade.html.markdown. Entries should focus on the changes that users need to make when upgrading to 6.0.0, rather than how to write configurations after upgrading. See Terraform provider for Google Cloud 5.0.0 Upgrade Guide and other upgrade guides for examples. Remove any deprecation notices and warnings (including in documentation) not already removed by the breaking change. When you create your pull request, change the base branch to FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 To resolve merge conflicts with git rebase or git merge, use FEATURE-BRANCH-major-release-6.0.0 instead of main.

For a full list of available properties, see type.go ↗.\nShared properties # name # Specifies the name of the field within Terraform. By default this will also be the key for the field in the API request message, if a separate api_name is not declared using the corresponding property.\ntype # Sets the expected data type of the field. All valid types are declared here.\nmin_version: beta # Marks the field (and any subfields) as beta-only. Ensure a beta version block is present in provider.yaml. Do not use if an ancestor field (or the overall resource) is already marked as beta-only.\nimmutable # If true, the field (and any subfields) are considered immutable - that is, only settable on create. If unset or false, the field is still considered immutable if any ancestor field (or the overall resource) is immutable, unless update_url is set.\nExample:\nimmutable: true update_url # If set, changes to the field\u0026rsquo;s value trigger a separate call to a specific API method for updating the field\u0026rsquo;s value. The field is not considered immutable even if an ancestor field (or the overall resource) is immutable. Terraform field names enclosed in double curly braces are replaced with the field values from the resource at runtime.\nExample:\nupdate_url: \u0026#39;projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/resourcenames/{{name}}/setFieldName\u0026#39; update_verb # If update_url is also set, overrides the verb used to update this specific field. Allowed values: \u0026lsquo;POST\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;PUT\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;PATCH\u0026rsquo;. Default: Resource\u0026rsquo;s update_verb (which defaults to \u0026lsquo;PUT\u0026rsquo; if unset).\nExample:\nupdate_verb: \u0026#39;POST\u0026#39; required # If true, the field is required. If unset or false, the field is optional.\nExample:\nrequired: true output # If true, the field is output-only - that is, it cannot be configured by the user. If unset or false, the field is configurable.\nExample:\noutput: true sensitive # If true, the field is considered \u0026ldquo;sensitive\u0026rdquo;, which means that its value will be obscured in Terraform output such as plans. If false, the value will not be obscured. Either way, the value will still be stored in plaintext in Terraform state. See Handling Sensitive Values in State for more information.\nSensitive fields are often not returned by the API (because they are sensitive). In this case, the field will also need to use ignore_read or a custom_flatten function.\nExample:\nsensitive: true ignore_read # If true, the provider sets the field\u0026rsquo;s value in the resource state based only on the user\u0026rsquo;s configuration. If false or unset, the provider sets the field\u0026rsquo;s value in the resource state based on the API response. Only use this attribute if the field cannot be read from GCP due to either API or provider constraints.\nNested fields currently do not support ignore_read but can replicate the behavior by implementing a custom_flatten that always ignores the value returned by the API. Example. Any fields using a custom flatten also need to be added to ignore_read_extra for any examples where the field is set.\nExample: YAML\nignore_read: true Example: Custom flatten\nfunc flatten{{$.GetPrefix}}{{$.TitlelizeProperty}}(v interface{}, d *schema.ResourceData, config *transport_tpg.Config) interface{} { return d.Get(\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;) } default_value # Sets a client-side default value for the field. This should be used if the API has a default value that applies in all cases and is stable. Removing or changing a default value is a breaking change. If unset, the field defaults to an \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; value (such as zero, false, or an empty string).\nExample:\ndefault_value: DEFAULT_VALUE default_from_api # If true, and the field is either not set or set to an \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; value (such as zero, false, or empty strings), the provider accepts any value returned from the API as the value for the field. If false, and the field is either not set or set to an \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; value, the provider treats the field\u0026rsquo;s default_value as the value for the field and shows a diff if the API returns any other value for the field. This attribute is useful for complex or frequently-changed API-side defaults, but provides less useful information at plan time than default_value and causes the provider to ignore user configurations that explicitly set the field to an \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; value. default_from_api and send_empty_value cannot both be true on the same field.\nExample:\ndefault_from_api: true send_empty_value # If true, the provider sends \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; values (such as zero, false, or empty strings) to the API if set explicitly in the user\u0026rsquo;s configuration. If false, \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; values cause the field to be omitted entirely from the API request. This attribute is useful for fields where the API would behave differently for an \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; value vs no value for a particular field - for example, boolean fields that have an API-side default of true. send_empty_value and default_from_api cannot both be true on the same field.\nDue to a bug, NestedObject fields will currently be sent as null if unset (rather than being omitted.)\nExample:\nsend_empty_value: true conflicts # Specifies a list of fields (excluding the current field) that cannot be specified at the same time as the current field. Must be set separately on all listed fields. Not supported within lists of nested objects.\nExample:\n- name: \u0026#39;fieldOne\u0026#39; type: String conflicts: - field_two - nested_object.0.nested_field required_with # Specifies a list of fields (excluding the current field) that must all be specified if at least one is specified.

Must be set separately on all listed fields.

Must be set separately on all listed fields. Not supported within lists of nested objects.\nExample:\n- name: \u0026#39;fieldOne\u0026#39; type: String at_least_one_of: - field_one - field_two - nested_object.0.nested_field diff_suppress_func # Specifies the name of a diff suppress function to use for this field. In many cases, a custom flattener is preferred because it will allow the user to see a clearer diff when the field actually is being changed. See Fix diffs for more information and best practices.\nThe function specified can be a provider-specific function (for example, tgpresource.CaseDiffSuppress) or a function defined in resource-specific custom code.\nExample:\n- name: \u0026#39;fieldOne\u0026#39; type: String diff_suppress_func: \u0026#39;tpgresource.CaseDiffSuppress\u0026#39; validation # Controls the value set for the field\u0026rsquo;s ValidateFunc.\nFor Enum fields, this will override the default validation (that the provided value is one of the enum values). If you need additional validation on top of an enum, ensure that the supplied validation func also verifies the enum values are correct.\nThis property has two mutually exclusive child properties:\nfunction: The name of a validation function to use for validation. The function can be a Terraform-provided function (for example, validation.IntAtLeast(0)), a provider-specific function (for example, verify.ValidateBase64String), or a function defined in resource-specific custom code. regex: A regex string to check values against. This can only be used on simple String fields. It is equivalent to function: verify.ValidateRegexp(REGEX_STRING). validation is not supported for Array fields (including sets); however, individual elements in the array can be validated using item_validation.\nExample: Provider-specific function\n- name: \u0026#39;fieldOne\u0026#39; type: String validation: function: \u0026#39;verify.ValidateBase64String\u0026#39; Example: Regex\n- name: \u0026#39;fieldOne\u0026#39; type: String validation: regex: \u0026#39;^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$\u0026#39; api_name # Specifies a name to use for communication with the API that is different than the name of the field in Terraform. In general, setting an api_name is not recommended, because it makes it more difficult for users and maintainers to understand how the resource maps to the underlying API.\n- name: \u0026#39;fieldOne\u0026#39; type: String api_name: otherFieldName url_param_only # If true, the field is not sent in the resource body, and the provider does not read the field value from the API response. If unset or false, the field is sent in the resource body, and the provider reads the field value from the API response.\nurl_param_only: true Enum properties # enum_values # Enum only. If the allowed values change frequently, use a String field instead to allow better forwards-compatibility, and link to API documentation stating the current allowed values in the String field\u0026rsquo;s description. Do not include UNSPECIFIED values in this list.\nEnums will validate that the provided field is in the allowed list unless a custom validation is provided.\nExample:\nenum_values: - \u0026#39;VALUE_ONE\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;VALUE_TWO\u0026#39; Array properties # item_type # Array only.

Type-specific guidelines and examples # New field(s) Write your release note in the following format:\n```release-note:enhancement PRODUCT: added `FIELD_1`, `FIELD_2`, and `FIELD_N` fields to `RESOURCE_NAME` resource ``` Replace PRODUCT, FIELD_*, and RESOURCE_NAME according to the pull request content. For example:\n```release-note:enhancement compute: added `foo_bar` field to `google_compute_foo` resource ``` New resource Write your release note in the following format:\n```release-note:new-resource `RESOURCE_NAME` ``` Replace RESOURCE_NAME according to the pull request content. For example:\n```release-note:new-resource `google_compute_new_resource` ``` New datasource Write your release note in the following format:\n```release-note:new-datasource `DATASOURCE_NAME` ``` Replace DATASOURCE_NAME according to the pull request content. For example:\n```release-note:new-datasource `google_compute_new_datasource` ``` Other Choose a release note type # For each release note block, choose an appropriate type from the following list:\nenhancement : New features on existing resources bug : Bug fix deprecation : A field/resource is being marked as deprecated (not being removed) breaking-change : Changes that require users to change their configuration note : General type for other notes that might be relevant to users but don\u0026rsquo;t fit into another category none : Changes where there is no user impact, like test fixes, website updates and CI changes. Release notes of this type should be empty. Guidelines # Do Don\u0026rsquo;t Use past tense to describe the end state after the change is released. Start with a verb. For example, \u0026ldquo;added\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;fixed\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;resolved\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. You can use future tense to describe future changes, such as saying that a deprecated field will be removed in a future version. Don\u0026rsquo;t use present or future tense to describe changes that are included in the pull request. Write user-focused release notes. For example, reference specific impacted terraform resource and field names, and discuss changes in behavior users will experience. Avoid API field/resource/feature names. Avoid implementation details. Avoid language that requires understanding of provider internals. Surround resource or field names with backticks. Don\u0026rsquo;t use resource or field names without punctuation or with other punctuation like quotation marks. Use impersonal third person. Don\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo;, etc. If the pull request impacts any specific, begin your release note with that product name followed by a colon. Use lower case for the first letter after the colon. For example, cloudrun: added... For MMv1 resources, use the folder name that contains the yaml files as the product name; for handwritten or tpgtools resources, use the API subdomain; for broad cross-product changes, use provider. Don\u0026rsquo;t begin your release note with the full resource name. Don\u0026rsquo;t add backticks around the product name. Don\u0026rsquo;t capitalize the first letter after the colon. Examples # ```release-note:bug cloudrun: fixed perma-diff in `google_cloud_run_service` ``` ```release-note:deprecation container: deprecated `region` and `zone` on `google_container_unicorn`. Use `location` instead. ``` "},{"id":15,"href":"/magic-modules/develop/add-fields/","title":"Add a field to an existing resource","section":"Develop","content":" Add a field to an existing resource # This page describes how to add a field to an existing resource in the google or google-beta Terraform provider using MMv1 and/or handwritten code. In general, Terraform resources should implement all configurable fields and all read-only fields. Even fields that seem like they would not be useful in Terraform (like update time or etag) often end up being requested by users, so it\u0026rsquo;s usually easier to just add them all at once.

Complex maps can\u0026rsquo;t be represented natively in Terraform, and this type is transformed into an associative array (TypeSet) with the key merged into the object alongside other top-level fields.\nFor key_name and key_description, provide a domain-appropriate name and description. For example, a map that references a specific type of resource would generally use the singular resource kind as the key name (such as \u0026ldquo;topic\u0026rdquo; for PubSub Topic) and a descriptor of the expected format depending on the context (such as resourceId vs full resource name).\nModify the field configuration according to the API documentation and behavior. Note: The templates in this section only include the most commonly-used fields. For a comprehensive reference, see MMv1 field reference. For information about modifying the values sent and received for a field, see Modify the API request or response.\nHandwritten Add the field to the handwritten resource\u0026rsquo;s schema. The new field(s) should mirror the API\u0026rsquo;s structure to ease predictability and maintenance. However, if there is an existing related / similar field in the resource that uses a different convention, follow that convention instead. Enum fields in the API should be represented as TypeString in Terraform for forwards-compatibility. Link to the API documentation of allowed values in the field description. Terraform field names should always use snake case ↗. See Schema Types ↗ and Schema Behaviors ↗ for more information about field schemas. Add handling for the new field in the resource\u0026rsquo;s Create method and Update methods. \u0026ldquo;Expanders\u0026rdquo; convert Terraform resource data to API request data. For top level fields, add an expander. If the field is set or has changed, call the expander and add the resulting value to the API request. For other fields, add logic to the parent field\u0026rsquo;s expander to add the field to the API request. Use a nested expander for complex logic. Add handling for the new field in the resource\u0026rsquo;s Read method. \u0026ldquo;Flatteners\u0026rdquo; convert API response data to Terraform resource data. For top level fields, add a flattener. Call d.Set() on the flattened API response value to store it in Terraform state. For other fields, add logic to the parent field\u0026rsquo;s flattener to convert the value from the API response to the Terraform state value. Use a nested flattener for complex logic. If any of the added Go code (including any imports) is beta-only, change the file suffix to .go.tmpl and wrap the beta-only code in a version guard: {{- if ne $.TargetVersionName \u0026quot;ga\u0026quot; -}}...{{- else }}...{{- end }}. Add a new guard rather than adding the field to an existing guard; it is easier to read.

In some cases, it may be possible to create and delete the resource (but only one can exist at a time); in other cases the resource always exists and can only be read and updated.\nImplementing resources like this may require some or all of the following:\nIf there isn\u0026rsquo;t a create endpoint, set the create_url to point to the update endpoint. If there is a create endpoint, add pre-create custom code that implements \u0026ldquo;acquire-on-create\u0026rdquo; logic. The custom code should check whether the resource already exists with a read request, and if it does, run the update logic and return early. For example, see mmv1/templates/terraform/pre_create/firebasehosting_site.go.tmpl. Note: The main disadvantage of \u0026ldquo;acquire-on-create\u0026rdquo; logic is that users will not be presented with a diff between the resource\u0026rsquo;s old and new states – because from the terraform perspective, the resource is only being created.

They are simply read-only operations that will expose some sort of values needed for subsequent resource operations. If you\u0026rsquo;re adding a field to an existing datasource, check the Resource section. Everything there will be mostly consistent with the type of change you\u0026rsquo;ll need to make. For adding a new datasource there are 5 steps to doing so.\nCreate a new datasource declaration file and a corresponding test file Add Schema and Read operation implementation If there is labels field with type KeyValueLabels in the corresponding resource, in the datasource Read operation implementation, after the resource read method, call the function tpgresource.SetDataSourceLabels(d) to make labels and terraform_labels have all of the labels on the resource.

Otherwise implementing the schema directly, similar to normal resource creation, is the desired path.\nResourceless Datasources # Datasources not backed by a resource are possible to add as well. They follow the same general steps as adding a resource-based datasource, except that a full Read method will need to be defined for them rather than calling a resource\u0026rsquo;s Read method.\nNote that while resource-based datasources can depend on the resource read method for API calls, resourceless datasources need to make them themselves. An HTTP-based client that\u0026rsquo;s properly configured with logging and retries must be used, such as a client from the https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-go-client library, or the raw HTTP client used in MMV1 through SendRequest.\nAdd documentation # Open the data source documentation in magic-modules/third_party/terraform/website/docs/d/ using an editor of your choice.

Custom code can be used to add arbitrary logic to a resource while still generating most of the code; it allows for a balance between maintainability and supporting real-worlds APIs that deviate from what MMv1 can support. Custom code should only be added if the desired behavior can\u0026rsquo;t be achieved otherwise.\nMost custom code attributes are strings that contain a path to a template file relative to the mmv1 directory. For example:\ncustom_code: # References mmv1/templates/terraform/custom_delete/resource_name_custom_delete.go.tmpl custom_delete: templates/terraform/custom_delete/resource_name_custom_delete.go.tmpl By convention, the template files are stored in a directory matching the type of custom code, and the name of the file includes the resource (and, if relevant, field) impacted by the custom code. Like handwritten resource and test code, custom code is written as go templates which render go code.\nWhen in doubt about the behavior of custom code, write the custom code, generate the providers, and inspect what changed in the providers using git diff.\nThe following sections describe types of custom code in more detail.\nAdd reusable variables and functions # custom_code: constants: templates/terraform/constants/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl Use custom_code.constants to inject top-level code in a resource file. This is useful for anything that should be referenced from other parts of the resource, such as:\nConstants Regexes compiled at build time Functions, such as diff suppress functions, validation functions, CustomizeDiff functions, and so on. Methods Any custom functions added should have thorough unit tests.\nModify the API request or response # API requests and responses can be modified in the following order:\nModify the API request value for a specific field Modify the API request data for an entire resource Modify the API response data for an entire resource Modify the API response value for a specific field These are described in more detail in the following sections.\nModify the API request value for a specific field # - name: \u0026#39;FIELD\u0026#39; type: String custom_expand: \u0026#39;templates/terraform/custom_expand/PRODUCT_RESOURCE_FIELD.go.tmpl\u0026#39; Set custom_expand on a field to inject code that modifies the value to send to the API for that field. Custom expanders run before any encoder or update_encoder. The referenced file must include the function signature for the expander. For example:\nfunc expand{{$.GetPrefix}}{{$.TitlelizeProperty}}(v interface{}, d tpgresource.TerraformResourceData, config *transport_tpg.Config) (interface{}, error) { if v == nil { return nil, nil } return base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString([]byte(v.(string))), nil } The parameters the function receives are:\nv: The value for the field d: Terraform resource data. Use d.Get(\u0026quot;field_name\u0026quot;) to get a field\u0026rsquo;s current value. config: Config object. Can be used to make API calls. The function returns a final value that will be sent to the API.\nModify the API request data for an entire resource # custom_code: encoder: templates/terraform/encoder/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl update_encoder: templates/terraform/update_encoder/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl Use custom_code.encoder to inject code that modifies the data that will be sent in the API request. This is useful if the API expects the data to be in a significantly different structure than Terraform does - for example, if the API expects the entire object to be nested under a key, or a particular field must never be sent to the API. The encoder will run after any custom_expand code.\nThe encoder code will be wrapped in a function like:\nfunc resourceProductResourceEncoder(d *schema.ResourceData, meta interface{}, obj map[string]interface{}) (map[string]interface{}, error) { // Your code will be injected here. } The parameters the function receives are:\nd: Terraform resource data. Use d.Get(\u0026quot;field_name\u0026quot;) to get a field\u0026rsquo;s current value. meta: Can be cast to a Config object (which can make API calls) using meta.(*transport_tpg.Config) obj: The data that will be sent to the API. The function returns data that will be sent to the API and an optional error.\nIf the Create and Update methods for the resource need different logic, set custom_code.update_encoder to override the logic for update only. It is otherwise the same as custom_code.encoder.\nModify the API response data for an entire resource # custom_code: decoder: templates/terraform/decoder/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl Use custom_code.decoder to inject code that modifies the data recieved from an API response. This is useful if the API returns data in a significantly different structure than what Terraform expects - for example, if the API returns the entire object nested under a key, or uses a different name for a field in the response than in the request. The decoder will run before any custom_flatten code.\nThe decoder code will be wrapped in a function like:\nfunc resourceProductResourceDecoder(d *schema.ResourceData, meta interface{}, res map[string]interface{}) (map[string]interface{}, error) { // Your code will be injected here. } The parameters the function receives are:\nd: Terraform resource data. Use d.Get(\u0026quot;field_name\u0026quot;) to get a field\u0026rsquo;s current value. meta: Can be cast to a Config object (which can make API calls) using meta.(*transport_tpg.Config) res: The data (\u0026ldquo;response\u0026rdquo;) returned by the API. The function returns data that will be set in Terraform state and an optional error.\nModify the API response value for a specific field # - name: \u0026#39;FIELD\u0026#39; type: String custom_flatten: \u0026#39;templates/terraform/custom_flatten/PRODUCT_RESOURCE_FIELD.go.tmpl\u0026#39; Set custom_flatten on a field to inject code that modifies the value returned by the API prior to storing it in Terraform state. Custom flatteners run after any decoder. The referenced file must include the function signature for the flattener. For example:\nfunc flatten{{$.GetPrefix}}{{$.TitlelizeProperty}}(v interface{}, d *schema.ResourceData, config *transport_tpg.Config) interface{} { if v == nil { return \u0026#34;0\u0026#34; } return v } The parameters the function receives are:\nv: The value for the field d: Terraform resource data. Use d.Get(\u0026quot;field_name\u0026quot;) to get a field\u0026rsquo;s current value. config: Config object. Can be used to make API calls. The function returns a final value that will be stored in Terraform state for the field, which will be compared with the user\u0026rsquo;s configuration to determine if there is a diff.\nInject code before / after CRUD operations and Import # custom_code: pre_create: templates/terraform/pre_create/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl post_create: templates/terraform/post_create/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl pre_read: templates/terraform/pre_read/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl pre_update: templates/terraform/pre_update/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl post_update: templates/terraform/post_update/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl pre_delete: templates/terraform/pre_delete/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl post_delete: templates/terraform/post_delete/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl post_import: templates/terraform/post_import/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl CRUD operations can be modified with pre/post hooks. This code will be injected directly into the relevant CRUD method as close as possible to the related API call and will have access to any variables that are present when it runs. pre_create and pre_update run after any encoder. Some example use cases:\nUse post_create to set an update-only field after create finishes. Use pre_delete to detach a disk before deleting it. Use post_import to parse attributes from the import ID and call d.Set(\u0026quot;field\u0026quot;) so that the resource can be read from the API. Custom create error handling # custom_code: post_create_failure: templates/terraform/post_create_failure/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl Use custom_code.post_create_failure to inject code that runs if a Create request to the API returns an error.\nThe post_create_failure code will be wrapped in a function like:\nfunc resourceProductResourcePostCreateFailure(d *schema.ResourceData, meta interface{}) { // Your code will be injected here. } The parameters the function receives are:\nd: Terraform resource data. Use d.Get(\u0026quot;field_name\u0026quot;) to get a field\u0026rsquo;s current value. meta: Can be cast to a Config object (which can make API calls) using meta.(*transport_tpg.Config) Custom retry handling # error_retry_predicates: - \u0026#39;transport_tpg.IamMemberMissing\u0026#39; error_abort_predicates: - \u0026#39;transport_tpg.Is429QuotaError\u0026#39; Use error_retry_predicates or error_abort_predicates functions to retry or abort when encountering certain error responses. By default, errors are retried using this list of retry predicates. error_retry_predicates can be used to make more errors retryable, while error_abort_predicates can be used to prevent errors from being retried.\nBoth functions use the following signature:\nfunc (err error) (bool, string) {} The function takes an error and returns:\nbool: whether the error should be retried/aborted string: a reason that will be logged Replace entire CRUD methods # custom_code: custom_create: templates/terraform/custom_create/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl custom_update: templates/terraform/custom_update/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl custom_delete: templates/terraform/custom_delete/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl custom_import: templates/terraform/custom_import/PRODUCT_RESOURCE.go.tmpl Custom methods replace the entire contents of the Create, Update, Delete, or Import methods. For example:\nfunc resourceProductResourceImport(d *schema.ResourceData, meta interface{}) ([]*schema.ResourceData, error) { // Your code will be injected here. } Custom methods are similar to handwritten code and should be avoided if possible. If you have to replace two or more methods, the resource should be handwritten instead.\nAdd extra fields to a resource # Use custom_code.extra_schema_entry to add additional fields to a resource. Do not use extra_schema_entry unless there is no other option. The extra fields are injected at the end of the resource\u0026rsquo;s Schema field. They should be formatted as entries in the map.

They can also show up for users at plan time, on fields that a user has not modified in their configuration. If the diff does not go away even after running terraform apply more than once with the same configuration, the diff is called a \u0026ldquo;permadiff\u0026rdquo;.\nIn a general sense, diffs appear when the API response is detected by Terraform to be different than what is in the user\u0026rsquo;s configuration. This can happen for a number of reasons, including:\nAPI returns a normalized version of the input API returns server-side defaults if the field is unset API does not return all the fields set on a resource (for example, secrets) The sections below describe in more detail how to address a number of different causes of diffs.\nAPI returns default value for unset field # For new fields, if possible, set a client-side default that matches the API default.

If the field is not set (or is set to an \u0026ldquo;empty\u0026rdquo; value such as zero, false, or an empty string) the provider will treat the most recent value returned by the API as the value for the field, and will send that value for the field on subsequent requests.
